"September 9, 2018 1:47:48 am","Across the Aisle: Black to white magic","RBI had done no study or preparatory work; yet the Central Board of RBI hurriedly met on November 8, without an agenda and without a background note, and dutifully “recommended” that the notes may be declared no longer legal tender.","P Chidambaram","Demonetisation is done but not yet dusted. With the release of the RBI’s Annual Report for 2017-18, the ghost of demonetisation has come back to haunt the government of Mr  . A policy may be well-intended, yet flawed. In the case of demonetisation it is difficult to believe that the policy was well-intended because of the opaque process that was followed before the decision was announced. On November 7, 2016, the government told RBI to send its recommendation on the proposed demonetisation of currency (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes) by the next day. RBI had done no study or preparatory work; yet the Central Board of RBI hurriedly met on November 8, without an agenda and without a background note, and dutifully “recommended” that the notes may be declared no longer legal tender. The Chief Economic Adviser was not consulted or taken into confidence: on November 8 he was in Kerala to deliver a talk. A Note for Cabinet was not prepared and circulated to the Cabinet or tabled at the Cabinet meeting held on November 8. Ministers who were present have admitted, privately, that they were “told” at the meeting that currency will be demonetised. Nevertheless, let me assume that the decision to demonetise currency was taken with the intention of achieving certain objectives — seizing black money, ending counterfeiting of currency notes and stopping the financing of terrorism. None of the objectives has been achieved: hoards of black (i.e. unaccounted) money in new currency notes continue to be seized; counterfeit currency in the new denominations and design continue to be detected; and terrorism continues unabated and is presumably financed by new currency notes. In the light of the failed objectives, what should the people conclude on demonetisation? I shall reserve my conclusion for the end and look at one important outcome of demonetisation — its impact on saving, especially household saving. According to the RBI, currency in circulation on October 28, 2016 (before demonetisation) was of the value of Rs 17,54,022 crore. On August 17, 2018, the currency in circulation was Rs 19,17,129 crore! So, we are not a less-cash economy because of demonetisation. How is this currency in circulation accounted for? For the answer, see Table 1.   1. The people of India trust cash. They are keeping more cash with them today than in 2015-16. The amount of cash in hand has actually doubled from 1.4 to 2.8 per cent. Consequently, cash in the form of deposits with banks has declined from 4.6 to 2.9 per cent. 2. People have borrowed more and their liabilities have increased from 2.8 to 4 per cent. As a result, while the gross household saving is higher, the net household saving has declined from 8.1 to 7.1 per cent. 3. The fall in net household saving has impacted investment measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and its components: see Table 2. 4. The fall in GFCF naturally affected the growth rate since demonetisation. It is too early to celebrate the 2018-19 Q1 growth rate of 8.2 per cent because it is on the lowest base of 5.6 per cent recorded in 16 quarters since the NDA came to power. Going forward, the ‘base effect’ will not be so favourable. Hence, even if the economy maintains its current pace of growth, the quarterly growth rate is likely to slide in the next three quarters.   Given these facts, it is amusing to see the government’s spokespersons inventing new arguments to flaunt the ‘success’ of demonetisation. The favourite argument is that the tax base has increased. True, a record 5.42 crore income tax returns have been filed in the current year. But, remember that 1 crore filers return ‘nil’ tax liability and pay no income tax! Besides, the increase in direct tax revenue is only 6.6 per cent against a budgeted increase of 14.4 per cent. There is also the pie-in-the-sky argument: thousands of suspicious accounts and transactions are under scrutiny. Good, but when will the process, including appeals and further appeals, be completed? The government is counting its chicken before they are hatched. Meanwhile, the public perception is that tax terrorism has been unleashed upon individuals and businesses. The next argument is rapid digitisation. Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the value of digital transactions has increased annually at 14.3, 10.7, 9.1, 24.4 and 12 per cent, indicating no acceleration in the pace because of demonetisation. Moreover, digitisation has been achieved in other countries without the disruption and pain of demonetisation and could have been achieved in India too. At the end of the day, after being told that Rs 15,31,000 crore has been returned to the RBI, the general perception is that demonetisation was an ingenious device to facilitate a number of people to convert their black money into white money through a simple over-the-counter exchange at banks!

"September 9, 2018 11:29:27 am","Fifth Column: A false narrative","The essence of the new narrative is that Modi has ‘destroyed’ the institutions of democracy and that if he gets a second term he will make sure elections are never held again.","Tavleen Singh"," has made mistakes since he became Prime Minister. Serious ones. And, this column has not hesitated to point them out. But, what I refuse to do is become party to the new narrative of lies being spread by a cabal of leftists, liberals and disgruntled ex-BJP ministers that speaks loudest in the public square. This mostly leftist cabal has had control of the megaphone since 1947, but has used it most effectively in the past four years. The megaphone gets louder by the day now that Modi is seen to be weaker politically than before. The essence of the new narrative is that Modi has ‘destroyed’ the institutions of democracy and that if he gets a second term he will make sure elections are never held again. These doomsayers appear to have forgotten that this was tried once before by   and despite press censorship and the suspension of all fundamental rights she could not sustain her dictatorship beyond two years. Luckily for us India is made up of many states, the people of which speak in many tongues. Very rarely do they fight in the same revolution. It is important to remember that after the Emergency the southern states voted for Mrs Gandhi because the effects of the Emergency were not felt there as much as they were in north India. Now let us examine how many institutions of democracy Modi has succeeded in ‘destroying’ since 2014. Parliament. He is the first Prime Minister in 30 years to have won a full majority and yet it is the Congress party with its handful of MPs who have controlled Parliament’s functioning. If it has seemed mostly non-functional for four years it is because this party’s 44 MPs have made it so. Notice that almost the only time there has been relative quiet in the Lok Sabha was on the day that the Congress President performed his hug and wink charade. So Modi cannot be blamed for not preventing debate on vital laws. The judiciary. Personally I agree with Fali Nariman, the Supreme Court’s eminence grise, when he says that the day four senior judges called a press conference was a truly black day. Had they gone public to explain why it takes decades for justice to be done in India even in cases of terrorism, murder and rape, they would have deserved a standing ovation. Instead they chose to go public only to complain about not being allowed to decide which judges should be on which bench, while admitting that this was definitely the Chief Justice’s prerogative. That press conference diminished the Supreme Court but the judges were hailed as shining heroes by the cabal described in paragraph one. The Executive. According to the new narrative Modi is so authoritarian that he does not consult his ministers on matters of grave importance such as national security and the economy. It is his prerogative to consult or not. But, he has not complained when he has been personally blamed for demonetisation and for implementing GST badly. He did not complain when Rahul Gandhi accused him of using demonetisation to ‘steal’ the people’s money only to give it to a ‘handful of his rich friends.’ Nor has he protested when lynchings by cow vigilantes have been blamed on him personally. The media. He has not held a single press conference or given a single real interview since he became Prime Minister and this has harmed him more than it has harmed the media. I hear from colleagues that they have been called up and threatened when they have written a story that shows the government in a bad light. I have also heard that some editors lost their jobs because of their political views but I also hear every day on television and in the newspapers many, many personal attacks on the Prime Minister. On social media BJP trolls are so partisan and foolishly abusive that it’s clear that Modi’s supposedly sinister social media cell is staggeringly incompetent. The final charge against Modi is that he is weakening democracy by appointing Hindutva types to positions of importance in universities and other educational institutions. Well, is he going to appoint those people instead who openly call him a fascist? University campuses have been bastions of not just the Left but of the extreme Left ever since I went to college 40 years ago. If there are new voices today on campuses it should be considered a welcome change. It is worth remembering that when   was prime minister similar complaints were made against his HRD Minister all the time. His efforts to paint ancient Hindu India as a place where beef was never eaten were publicly mocked. That is as far as he got with erasing history. More proof that a false narrative always gets found out. For all the latest  , download "
"September 9, 2018 1:44:04 am","Out of my Mind: A grave danger","While the Supreme Court came through with flying colours with its verdict on Section 377, it did something in the week before which has hardly been remarked upon. ","Meghnad Desai","The Supreme Court has struck a blow for freedom and equality by getting rid of 377 which was a peculiarly horrid Victorian law making people live false lives. There is nothing in Indian culture, no matter how far back you go, which disapproved of, let alone criminalised homosexuality. We need to examine the Indian Penal Code line by line and bring it in line with 21st century values of dignity and mutual respect across all identities that people may adopt. The Victorian, colonial State that we inherited but never fully rejected needs to be removed from lives of all Indians. But while the Supreme Court came through with flying colours in this case, it did something in the week before which has hardly been remarked upon. The Court ruled that someone from outside a state is not eligible to claim reservation granted by the state. When a state grants reservations they are only for ‘citizens’ of the state and not outsiders. This strikes a crippling blow at the idea of a single citizenship for all Indians. No matter whether ‘insiders’ or ‘outsiders’, Indians should be free to live and work and enjoy reservations they qualify for, all across India. The Honourable Supreme Court’s decision means that only the upper castes who are not entitled to reservations (and the non-Hindus) are able to enjoy the rights of mobility across India without paying a cost. Reservations are a handicap for the ‘reserved’ if granted by the state and not the Centre. In other words, state reservations are not open to all Indians. This is a very serious matter with long-run consequences that could change the nature of the Indian Union. The conduct of the   in Assam has already raised the notion that to live, work and vote in Assam you have to show you were born in Assam (speaking Assamese an advantage) or you have proof of long residence.

It would be easy to be complacent. What do us lay people know about the higher intricacies of the Constitution and why not just let the Supreme Court deal with it. But the idea implicit in the judgment is that state reservations are for state ‘citizens’ and not ‘outsiders’. The next step will be to extend that to all government jobs.

"September 9, 2018 1:24:37 am","Inside Track: Vanishing line","The BJP high command and the PMO have been pressing the chief ministers of BJP- ruled states to furnish statistics of the beneficiaries of different Central and state government schemes at the state, district, block and village level.","Coomi Kapoor","The BJP high command and the PMO have been pressing the chief ministers of BJP- ruled states to furnish statistics of the beneficiaries of different Central and state government schemes at the state, district, block and village level. The data has to include   numbers, addresses and mobile numbers, if any. Among the 23 schemes, some of them repackaged and fast tracked, are: Ujjawala, MGNREGA, Jan Dhan and Direct Benefit Transfer. The government wants updated data till October 1. It is speculated that the information is being compiled so that PM Modi can mention names of beneficiaries when he visits a particular region. The states have also been asked to prepare a chart with precise dates on which the beneficiaries received the benefits. This second round of data collection will start in January and is to be completed by February 15. This suggests that the government does not plan to advance the Lok Sabha elections and also that the line between government and party has virtually vanished. Ever since the Prime Minister met popular Malayalam film actor Mohanlal, it is speculated that the BJP hopes to persuade him to stand as its candidate from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency next year. Thiruvananthapuram is one Kerala constituency which the BJP had set its sights on for decades. But its candidate, the dogged O Rajagopal lost repeatedly, his vote tally far behind the two main contestants, the Congress and the CPI. But in 2014 the BJP voteshare shot up by 20 per cent and Rajagopal, now 88, lost to the Congress’s   by a mere two per cent of the votes and emerged second. Modi tweeted after his interaction with Mohanlal waxing eloquent about the actor’s humility and social services. The actor had called on Modi to invite him for a programme to his Viswa Santhi Foundation, but has disavowed any political ambitions. Rahul Gandhi has formed three major committees for the 2019 polls. The core committee, the manifesto committee and the publicity committee. While veterans such as Ahmed Patel, Anand Sharma, Ghulam Nabi Azad, P Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh have been included, Kapil Sibal was left out. The leading lawyer does not just represent most Congress leaders in major court cases, but he has considerable clout in other parties, since he is the legal counsel for party bosses such as Lalu Prasad and  . Sibal was kept out of all three panels because of internal party politics. After belated realisation of the lacuna, Sibal was added to the publicity committee, but he declined the position. Actually Sibal’s just released book Shades of Truth can be an excellent reference source for any Congress publicity material for the forthcoming polls. Jignesh Mevani, Alpesh Thakor and Hardik Patel are positioning themselves for a greater say in the distribution of Congress tickets in next year’s general elections. Hardik has gone on fast for his demand for quota reservation for Patels. Though he has lost much weight and has written out his will, Congress cadres are not overly enthused by his campaign. (Incidentally when Medha Patkar tried to meet Hardik, she was turned away by his supporters who felt she was anti- Gujarat for opposing the Narmada dam). Hardik wants to contest from Mehsana and is expected to win. Mevani, though not in the Congress, wants the ticket from Bhuj, a reserved constituency. If Rahul Gandhi obliges the rest of the party is likely to be up in arms. Unlike the other two, Alpesh, the Congress MLA from Radhanpur, does not have national ambitions but has dreams of emerging as CM of Gujarat. He wants a definite say in ticket distribution. Ratnakar Pandey was a familiar figure in Congress circles from 1985 to 1991 as the faithful standard bearer for the Gandhi family. Pandey along with Suresh Pachauri, SS Ahluwalia and Baba Mishra were known as the shouting brigade in the Rajya Sabha. They would stand up and scream whenever any opposition MP criticised then PM  , particularly on Bofors. After Rajiv’s death, Pandey, who claimed he helped Sonia learn Hindi, was at the forefront in the campaign to install Sonia as party head. His sycophancy was such that he once declared that if Sonia needed slippers he was happy to contribute his skin to make them. Last week, Pandey passed away almost unnoticed by his party. Sonia did not issue a statement and Rahul did not tweet condolences. Raj Babbar was instructed belatedly to send out a message of commiseration. For all the latest  , download "
"September 8, 2018 6:56:20 am","Rights over wrong","With Section 377 verdict, SC emphasises dynamic nature of Constitution, its counter-majoritarian role","Arundhati Katju","The Constitution Bench judgment in Navtej Singh Johar and Others v Union of India is a watershed moment in Indian constitutional jurisprudence. While the judgment has extended the cloak of constitutional protection to LGBT citizens, it has relevance to all minorities and indeed to all individuals. The judgment articulates a vision of constitutional supremacy that will guide Indian democracy well into the future. It protects LGBT citizens under the right to equality, along with privacy and dignity. Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice AM Khanwilkar’s judgment puts the individual, and, as they poetically call it, the “overarching ideals of individual autonomy and liberty”, at the heart of the constitutional scheme. In the Chief Justice’s words, “Destruction of individual identity would tantamount to crushing of intrinsic dignity that cumulatively encapsulates the values of privacy, choice, and freedom of speech and other expressions.” In Johar’s vision, individual identity is constitutionally protected. It is this focus on the individual that leads Johar to overturn Suresh Kumar Koushal vs Naz Foundation (2013). The court has emphatically held that fundamental rights do not hinge on the number of people who claim them. Koushal’s reasoning that Section 377 should not be struck down because LGBT people constitute a “minuscule minority” has been put to rest in Johar. The Constitution doesn’t just protect minorities, the individual is the basic unit of the constitutional scheme. The court has thus reiterated its commitment to its counter-majoritarian role. Further, the court has emphasised the dynamic nature of constitutional interpretation and indeed of the Constitution itself. Constitutional courts breathe life into the Constitution through their dynamic and purposive interpretation of the constitutional text. This dynamic interpretation ensures that the Constitution endures across generations. But, as the judgment notes, dynamic interpretation is also essential to enable transformative constitutionalism. Citing NM Thomas, Chief Justice Misra recalls that the Indian Constitution is a “great social document, Supreme Court calls the Constitution of India a great social document, almost revolutionary in its aim of transforming a medieval, hierarchical society into a modern, egalitarian democracy”. The very purpose of constitutionalism is to transform society. Dynamic constitutional interpretation allows for the progressive realisation of rights as societies evolve. Johar also builds on the Supreme Court’s right to choice jurisprudence. Starting with Common Cause v Union of India, the court held that choice was constitutionally protected under Article 21 of the Constitution. The right to choice was extended to the choice of partner under  ’s case and the khap panchayat’s judgment. Now, with Johar, the Supreme Court has extended the right to choice to LGBT persons. The court has, finally, struck down Section 377 because it violates Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. Performing its classic function of judicial review, the court has struck down Section 377 as being violative of Articles 14 and 15. Justice Nariman has rightly begun Johar’s equality analysis with the landmark judgment, Anuj Garg v Hotel Association of India, where Justice SB Sinha emphasised the need for dynamic constitutional interpretation in cases concerning gender equality. Justices Misra and Khanwilkar found that Section 377 has no constitutionally valid object inasmuch as non-consensual acts criminalised under Section 377 have already been made penal offences under Section 375 IPC. They have also found Section 377 IPC to be arbitrary because it criminalises sexual acts between adults who are competent to give their consent, and puts undue limitations on their liberty. Crucially, Justices DY Chandrachud and  , in their concurring opinions, have also found that Section 377 violates Article 15’s prohibition against sex discrimination, specifically noting that “sex” under Article 15 includes “sexual orientation”. Justice Chandrachud has also relied on Anuj Garg to reiterate that Article 15 rejects discrimination based on sex-based stereotypes. Reading these opinions together, the Constitution’s entire equality code has been extended to LGBT persons. This is a groundbreaking jurisprudential development. In Justice Chandrachud’s words, the Johar case “is about an aspiration to realise constitutional rights… Article 14 contains a powerful statement of values — of the substance of equality before the law and the equal protection of laws.” The court’s emphasis on equality helps LGBT citizens realise these rights in full. Justice Malhotra has also noted that relationships between same-sex couples have been accorded protection across the world. Chief Justice Misra has protected the LGBT community’s “right to companionship” under Article 21 of the Constitution, in a passage worth quoting in its entirety: “There can be no doubt that an individual also has a right to a union under Article 21 of the Constitution. When we say union, we do not mean the union of marriage, though marriage is a union. As a concept, union also means companionship in every sense of the word, be it physical, mental, sexual or emotional. The LGBT community is seeking realisation of its basic right to companionship, so long as such a companionship is consensual, free from the vice of deceit, force, coercion and does not result in violation of the fundamental rights of others.” Finally, the Johar judgment has also highlighted the need for rape law reform to protect male survivors of sexual violence. The judgment has struck down Section 377 to the extent that it relates to sexual relations between consenting adults. The law needs to provide for cases where men are the victims of sexual assault. But should this be done under Section 377, with its Victorian understanding of sexual relations? After the 2013 rape law amendments, we now recognise that sexual assault is not limited to penile-vaginal intercourse. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 protects child sexual assault victims, regardless of their gender. However, there is no law to protect adult male victims of sexual assault, whether they are cis- or transgender. Parliament needs to fill these lacunae in the law. For all the latest  , download "

"September 9, 2018 1:47:48 am","Across the Aisle: Black to white magic","RBI had done no study or preparatory work; yet the Central Board of RBI hurriedly met on November 8, without an agenda and without a background note, and dutifully “recommended” that the notes may be declared no longer legal tender.","P Chidambaram","Demonetisation is done but not yet dusted. With the release of the RBI’s Annual Report for 2017-18, the ghost of demonetisation has come back to haunt the government of Mr  . A policy may be well-intended, yet flawed. In the case of demonetisation it is difficult to believe that the policy was well-intended because of the opaque process that was followed before the decision was announced. On November 7, 2016, the government told RBI to send its recommendation on the proposed demonetisation of currency (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes) by the next day. RBI had done no study or preparatory work; yet the Central Board of RBI hurriedly met on November 8, without an agenda and without a background note, and dutifully “recommended” that the notes may be declared no longer legal tender. The Chief Economic Adviser was not consulted or taken into confidence: on November 8 he was in Kerala to deliver a talk. A Note for Cabinet was not prepared and circulated to the Cabinet or tabled at the Cabinet meeting held on November 8. Ministers who were present have admitted, privately, that they were “told” at the meeting that currency will be demonetised. Nevertheless, let me assume that the decision to demonetise currency was taken with the intention of achieving certain objectives — seizing black money, ending counterfeiting of currency notes and stopping the financing of terrorism. None of the objectives has been achieved: hoards of black (i.e. unaccounted) money in new currency notes continue to be seized; counterfeit currency in the new denominations and design continue to be detected; and terrorism continues unabated and is presumably financed by new currency notes. In the light of the failed objectives, what should the people conclude on demonetisation? I shall reserve my conclusion for the end and look at one important outcome of demonetisation — its impact on saving, especially household saving. According to the RBI, currency in circulation on October 28, 2016 (before demonetisation) was of the value of Rs 17,54,022 crore. On August 17, 2018, the currency in circulation was Rs 19,17,129 crore! So, we are not a less-cash economy because of demonetisation. How is this currency in circulation accounted for? For the answer, see Table 1.   1. The people of India trust cash. They are keeping more cash with them today than in 2015-16. The amount of cash in hand has actually doubled from 1.4 to 2.8 per cent. Consequently, cash in the form of deposits with banks has declined from 4.6 to 2.9 per cent. 2. People have borrowed more and their liabilities have increased from 2.8 to 4 per cent. As a result, while the gross household saving is higher, the net household saving has declined from 8.1 to 7.1 per cent. 3. The fall in net household saving has impacted investment measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and its components: see Table 2. 4. The fall in GFCF naturally affected the growth rate since demonetisation. It is too early to celebrate the 2018-19 Q1 growth rate of 8.2 per cent because it is on the lowest base of 5.6 per cent recorded in 16 quarters since the NDA came to power. Going forward, the ‘base effect’ will not be so favourable. Hence, even if the economy maintains its current pace of growth, the quarterly growth rate is likely to slide in the next three quarters.   Given these facts, it is amusing to see the government’s spokespersons inventing new arguments to flaunt the ‘success’ of demonetisation. The favourite argument is that the tax base has increased. True, a record 5.42 crore income tax returns have been filed in the current year. But, remember that 1 crore filers return ‘nil’ tax liability and pay no income tax! Besides, the increase in direct tax revenue is only 6.6 per cent against a budgeted increase of 14.4 per cent. There is also the pie-in-the-sky argument: thousands of suspicious accounts and transactions are under scrutiny. Good, but when will the process, including appeals and further appeals, be completed? The government is counting its chicken before they are hatched. Meanwhile, the public perception is that tax terrorism has been unleashed upon individuals and businesses. The next argument is rapid digitisation. Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the value of digital transactions has increased annually at 14.3, 10.7, 9.1, 24.4 and 12 per cent, indicating no acceleration in the pace because of demonetisation. Moreover, digitisation has been achieved in other countries without the disruption and pain of demonetisation and could have been achieved in India too. At the end of the day, after being told that Rs 15,31,000 crore has been returned to the RBI, the general perception is that demonetisation was an ingenious device to facilitate a number of people to convert their black money into white money through a simple over-the-counter exchange at banks!

"September 9, 2018 1:24:37 am","Inside Track: Vanishing line","The BJP high command and the PMO have been pressing the chief ministers of BJP- ruled states to furnish statistics of the beneficiaries of different Central and state government schemes at the state, district, block and village level.","Coomi Kapoor","The BJP high command and the PMO have been pressing the chief ministers of BJP- ruled states to furnish statistics of the beneficiaries of different Central and state government schemes at the state, district, block and village level. The data has to include   numbers, addresses and mobile numbers, if any. Among the 23 schemes, some of them repackaged and fast tracked, are: Ujjawala, MGNREGA, Jan Dhan and Direct Benefit Transfer. The government wants updated data till October 1. It is speculated that the information is being compiled so that PM Modi can mention names of beneficiaries when he visits a particular region. The states have also been asked to prepare a chart with precise dates on which the beneficiaries received the benefits. This second round of data collection will start in January and is to be completed by February 15. This suggests that the government does not plan to advance the Lok Sabha elections and also that the line between government and party has virtually vanished. Ever since the Prime Minister met popular Malayalam film actor Mohanlal, it is speculated that the BJP hopes to persuade him to stand as its candidate from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency next year. Thiruvananthapuram is one Kerala constituency which the BJP had set its sights on for decades. But its candidate, the dogged O Rajagopal lost repeatedly, his vote tally far behind the two main contestants, the Congress and the CPI. But in 2014 the BJP voteshare shot up by 20 per cent and Rajagopal, now 88, lost to the Congress’s   by a mere two per cent of the votes and emerged second. Modi tweeted after his interaction with Mohanlal waxing eloquent about the actor’s humility and social services. The actor had called on Modi to invite him for a programme to his Viswa Santhi Foundation, but has disavowed any political ambitions. Rahul Gandhi has formed three major committees for the 2019 polls. The core committee, the manifesto committee and the publicity committee. While veterans such as Ahmed Patel, Anand Sharma, Ghulam Nabi Azad, P Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh have been included, Kapil Sibal was left out. The leading lawyer does not just represent most Congress leaders in major court cases, but he has considerable clout in other parties, since he is the legal counsel for party bosses such as Lalu Prasad and  . Sibal was kept out of all three panels because of internal party politics. After belated realisation of the lacuna, Sibal was added to the publicity committee, but he declined the position. Actually Sibal’s just released book Shades of Truth can be an excellent reference source for any Congress publicity material for the forthcoming polls. Jignesh Mevani, Alpesh Thakor and Hardik Patel are positioning themselves for a greater say in the distribution of Congress tickets in next year’s general elections. Hardik has gone on fast for his demand for quota reservation for Patels. Though he has lost much weight and has written out his will, Congress cadres are not overly enthused by his campaign. (Incidentally when Medha Patkar tried to meet Hardik, she was turned away by his supporters who felt she was anti- Gujarat for opposing the Narmada dam). Hardik wants to contest from Mehsana and is expected to win. Mevani, though not in the Congress, wants the ticket from Bhuj, a reserved constituency. If Rahul Gandhi obliges the rest of the party is likely to be up in arms. Unlike the other two, Alpesh, the Congress MLA from Radhanpur, does not have national ambitions but has dreams of emerging as CM of Gujarat. He wants a definite say in ticket distribution. Ratnakar Pandey was a familiar figure in Congress circles from 1985 to 1991 as the faithful standard bearer for the Gandhi family. Pandey along with Suresh Pachauri, SS Ahluwalia and Baba Mishra were known as the shouting brigade in the Rajya Sabha. They would stand up and scream whenever any opposition MP criticised then PM  , particularly on Bofors. After Rajiv’s death, Pandey, who claimed he helped Sonia learn Hindi, was at the forefront in the campaign to install Sonia as party head. His sycophancy was such that he once declared that if Sonia needed slippers he was happy to contribute his skin to make them. Last week, Pandey passed away almost unnoticed by his party. Sonia did not issue a statement and Rahul did not tweet condolences. Raj Babbar was instructed belatedly to send out a message of commiseration. For all the latest  , download "
"September 8, 2018 6:56:20 am","Rights over wrong","With Section 377 verdict, SC emphasises dynamic nature of Constitution, its counter-majoritarian role","Arundhati Katju","The Constitution Bench judgment in Navtej Singh Johar and Others v Union of India is a watershed moment in Indian constitutional jurisprudence. While the judgment has extended the cloak of constitutional protection to LGBT citizens, it has relevance to all minorities and indeed to all individuals. The judgment articulates a vision of constitutional supremacy that will guide Indian democracy well into the future. It protects LGBT citizens under the right to equality, along with privacy and dignity. Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice AM Khanwilkar’s judgment puts the individual, and, as they poetically call it, the “overarching ideals of individual autonomy and liberty”, at the heart of the constitutional scheme. In the Chief Justice’s words, “Destruction of individual identity would tantamount to crushing of intrinsic dignity that cumulatively encapsulates the values of privacy, choice, and freedom of speech and other expressions.” In Johar’s vision, individual identity is constitutionally protected. It is this focus on the individual that leads Johar to overturn Suresh Kumar Koushal vs Naz Foundation (2013). The court has emphatically held that fundamental rights do not hinge on the number of people who claim them. Koushal’s reasoning that Section 377 should not be struck down because LGBT people constitute a “minuscule minority” has been put to rest in Johar. The Constitution doesn’t just protect minorities, the individual is the basic unit of the constitutional scheme. The court has thus reiterated its commitment to its counter-majoritarian role. Further, the court has emphasised the dynamic nature of constitutional interpretation and indeed of the Constitution itself. Constitutional courts breathe life into the Constitution through their dynamic and purposive interpretation of the constitutional text. This dynamic interpretation ensures that the Constitution endures across generations. But, as the judgment notes, dynamic interpretation is also essential to enable transformative constitutionalism. Citing NM Thomas, Chief Justice Misra recalls that the Indian Constitution is a “great social document, Supreme Court calls the Constitution of India a great social document, almost revolutionary in its aim of transforming a medieval, hierarchical society into a modern, egalitarian democracy”. The very purpose of constitutionalism is to transform society. Dynamic constitutional interpretation allows for the progressive realisation of rights as societies evolve. Johar also builds on the Supreme Court’s right to choice jurisprudence. Starting with Common Cause v Union of India, the court held that choice was constitutionally protected under Article 21 of the Constitution. The right to choice was extended to the choice of partner under  ’s case and the khap panchayat’s judgment. Now, with Johar, the Supreme Court has extended the right to choice to LGBT persons. The court has, finally, struck down Section 377 because it violates Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. Performing its classic function of judicial review, the court has struck down Section 377 as being violative of Articles 14 and 15. Justice Nariman has rightly begun Johar’s equality analysis with the landmark judgment, Anuj Garg v Hotel Association of India, where Justice SB Sinha emphasised the need for dynamic constitutional interpretation in cases concerning gender equality. Justices Misra and Khanwilkar found that Section 377 has no constitutionally valid object inasmuch as non-consensual acts criminalised under Section 377 have already been made penal offences under Section 375 IPC. They have also found Section 377 IPC to be arbitrary because it criminalises sexual acts between adults who are competent to give their consent, and puts undue limitations on their liberty. Crucially, Justices DY Chandrachud and  , in their concurring opinions, have also found that Section 377 violates Article 15’s prohibition against sex discrimination, specifically noting that “sex” under Article 15 includes “sexual orientation”. Justice Chandrachud has also relied on Anuj Garg to reiterate that Article 15 rejects discrimination based on sex-based stereotypes. Reading these opinions together, the Constitution’s entire equality code has been extended to LGBT persons. This is a groundbreaking jurisprudential development. In Justice Chandrachud’s words, the Johar case “is about an aspiration to realise constitutional rights… Article 14 contains a powerful statement of values — of the substance of equality before the law and the equal protection of laws.” The court’s emphasis on equality helps LGBT citizens realise these rights in full. Justice Malhotra has also noted that relationships between same-sex couples have been accorded protection across the world. Chief Justice Misra has protected the LGBT community’s “right to companionship” under Article 21 of the Constitution, in a passage worth quoting in its entirety: “There can be no doubt that an individual also has a right to a union under Article 21 of the Constitution. When we say union, we do not mean the union of marriage, though marriage is a union. As a concept, union also means companionship in every sense of the word, be it physical, mental, sexual or emotional. The LGBT community is seeking realisation of its basic right to companionship, so long as such a companionship is consensual, free from the vice of deceit, force, coercion and does not result in violation of the fundamental rights of others.” Finally, the Johar judgment has also highlighted the need for rape law reform to protect male survivors of sexual violence. The judgment has struck down Section 377 to the extent that it relates to sexual relations between consenting adults. The law needs to provide for cases where men are the victims of sexual assault. But should this be done under Section 377, with its Victorian understanding of sexual relations? After the 2013 rape law amendments, we now recognise that sexual assault is not limited to penile-vaginal intercourse. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 protects child sexual assault victims, regardless of their gender. However, there is no law to protect adult male victims of sexual assault, whether they are cis- or transgender. Parliament needs to fill these lacunae in the law. For all the latest  , download "

Its level was 3.53 metres above the red mark while the Jamuna was flowing 3.16 metres above the danger mark. Both the rivers are expected to rise further in the next 48 hours. In Varanasi, the Ganga was flowing about two metres above the red mark. The flood waters have entered Nagwa, Sankat Mochan, Lanka, Durga Kund, Assi, Mathighat, Harishchandra Ghat and the Godulia Chowk in the heart of the city. Banaras Hindu University has been virtually cut off from rest of the city, the road leading to it being under waist-deep water. Two persons, one of them matching the description given out by the police of the notorious criminal Billa, reportedly attacked Sukhdev Singh, a truck cleaner, with a blunt instrument and absconded with his vehicle from outside the Old Delhi Railway Station on the night of August 29, the day on which the bodies of the Chopra children were found. According to the complaint lodged with the police, two young men approached Sukhdev Singh, who was standing beside his vehicle parked near Pili Kholi at about 9.15 pm, attacked him with a blunt weapon, got into the truck and drove it away.

"September 8, 2018 12:45:06 am","More Oscars, merrier","Maybe it’s time to expand the categories within the same liberal, self-righteous framework","Editorials","For the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the latest battle between art and commerce seems to have ended in a draw. Earlier this year, the Academy had announced a new “popular” category for the Oscars, which would take into account audience responses and preferences over the professionals and critics who usually decide who gets arguably cinema’s most well-known honour. In light of the backlash that followed from the US film fraternity, including members of the Academy, the decision has been “postponed” and “additional inputs have been sought”. This sudden urge for a new category has a simple explanation: The viewership for the Oscars has been dropping, and it is likely that a dose of mainstream blockbusters is seen as the prescription to regain eyeballs and ad revenues. But the marketing minds at the Academy seem to have forgotten a basic B-school lesson: Don’t mess with the brand. The mainstream, frankly, makes enough money not to need the stamp of critical approval. But the solution to the problem of dwindling interest could indeed lie in new categories. It might be a good idea to expand within the liberal, self-congratulatory (and dare we say pretentious) framework that the Oscars have come to exemplify. “Best film based in a conflict zone”, for example, would have the American liberal feel even more righteously virtuous. “Print journalism is real journalism” is also a category that holds promise — both Spotlight and The Post have seen to that,   marketing notwithstanding. And in 2019 and 2020, what better way to fight the power in a big white house that abuses Hollywood in tweet after tweet than with “Best film about a democratic dictator”?

But until Thursday, while the usual suspects were banging away at lawyers, poets and activists arrested on the charge of sympathising with Maoists and allegedly instigating rioting, Srinivasan Jain of NDTV was one of the few who offered the context, with footage — sometimes from a shaky smartphone camera — from the gathering which resulted in arrests months after the event. Exhibit A is a pledge read to the audience at the Elgaar Conference on December 31 by Harshali Potdar, who was arrested in June, swearing allegiance to the Constitution and promising opposition to those who do not respect it. Exhibit B is a clip of Jignesh Mewani’s speech, in which he said that he does not care who wins the forthcoming state elections, so long as it is not the BJP. Exhibit C is simply extraordinary: the Mumbai activist Sudhir Dhawale reading a poem which could be paraphrased as, “If the revolution does not come, it would be better for the city to be in flames.” He has been jailed for his pains. And certainly, had he been on the beat in another age, chief inspector Dharpakad Kathale (substitute your favourite comic cop’s name) of the Mumbai police would have jugged Pablo Neruda for just one immortal line of verse: “Come and see the blood in the streets.” And there was blood on the NDTV studio floor, as one of the guests committed intellectual hara-kiri. Why is it that the RSS has such poor apologists? Its political arm, the BJP, flourishes on the strength of its outspoken spokespersons. Why does the parent organisation suffer so? On the show,  , who wears many hats off-camera, protested that Harshali Potdar’s pledge meant nothing. “Vijay Mallya and   can also claim to support the Constitution, and look what they are up to.” Good heavens, an advocate must never draw a parallel that leaves his own client open to unfriendly fire. Stuff is going on in New York. While the world watches Donald Trump going ballistic over an unsigned oped by his own staffer in The New York Times, which he regards as the fount of iniquity, The New Yorker has just weathered the most withering blast of friendly fire ever. Maybe not the mostest, which had broken out over a cover showing Barack and Michelle Obama bumping fists, in Islamic vestments and dressed to kill with an assault rifle, respectively. But most is bad enough, when the magazine appears to fear its readers and Steve Bannon in equal measure. New Yorker editor David Remnick invited white supremacist Trumpism architect Bannon to headline the magazine’s annual festival, but backed off when his staff, and Hollywood celebrities like Jim Carrey who were also featured, raised a storm. But in a note that he shared with his staff, Remnick explained precisely why he had chosen to interview Bannon before an audience, and why he had changed his mind. The latter is fairly obvious: an editor cannot destroy an event under his banner by being pig-headed about one person. But perfectly reasonable people have agreed with Bannon and attributed the change of heart to cowardice. Why Remnick had chosen to interview Bannon, however, is interesting: because an interview before a live audience would have denied him the freedom to flit off and on the record. Remnick clarified that it would not have been a friendly interview, and that the criticism that Bannon had left the White House did not matter, because his influence was pervasive. Personally, one would have liked to see how Bannon would have fared against the plain-dealing Remnick.

"September 8, 2018 12:40:35 am","Clashing With Kabul","Pakistan is finding it difficult to engage with Afghanistan on the lines it is familiar with","Khaled Ahmed","After becoming prime minister,   received a goodwill message from the president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani. It read like a routine gesture, but both Kabul and Islamabad have reached a point in their deadlocked relationship where they want “real peace”, that is, for the Taliban to end their aggression. Americans have killed the head of the Afghan Taliban in Pakistan with a drone; another American drone has killed the head of Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan. Both the states are suffering from the terrorism they once helped gestate. For Kabul, the north-south “national” divide continues to be a decision-making obstacle; for Pakistan, the presence of India in Afghanistan erects a roadblock it can’t go over. The American view of Afghanistan has changed under Trump: It wants to get out after setting up a strategic bulwark against China in the region with India’s help. The new American “special envoy” to Kabul is going to be Zalmay Khalilzad whom Pakistan doesn’t regard as a friend. Khalilzad, a Pashtun from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, thinks about Pakistan like the other nationalities of the north — Tajiks, Turkmen and the Hazara, etc — who form over 50 per cent of Afghanistan’s population. When he was ambassador in Kabul under the Bush administration, his hawkishness towards Pakistan offended the professional bureaucrats serving in the region. If you are a non-Pashtun Pakistani in Afghanistan on a business trip, pretend to be from India or you will get roughed up, so offended are the Pashtun Afghans carrying the baggage of rage over the creation of Pakistan that divided the Pashtun nation. (Afghanistan has never really accepted the Durand Line as the frontier separating “the nation”.) Despite Pakistan’s “hospitality” of millions of Afghan refugees over decades, the rancour hasn’t died down. On the other hand, Pakistan has ignored the non-Pashtuns of Afghanistan who would readily accept the Durand Line. Instead, Pakistan opposed the Tajik warlord Ahmad Shah Masud fighting the Pakistan-supported Pashtun warlord Hekmatyar inside Afghanistan. The US is bogged down and wants to leave. The Taliban refuse to talk to the US but are travelling in the region discussing the conflict. Their attack on Ghazni before Eid left the city helpless for days. Ghani was furious over the incompetence of his 3,00,000-strong army and got his ministers of defence and interior to resign before taking them back; but his chief security officer, Hanif Atmar, had to leave. The Taliban refused the truce he offered, looking forward to a Moscow “peace” meeting on September 4 — it looked so bad to Washington that Ghani had to get it postponed. The US is not happy with the situation developing in favour of China and Iran and is sending Khalilzad as its troubleshooter. Pakistan has gone from calling Afghanistan its strategic depth to being a victim at the hands of its own Taliban now hiding in Afghanistan. It has also turned to look more closely at the increasingly hostile Pashtun terrorists inside its own tribal belt. Some actions it has taken to clean up the sanctuaries of terror have hurt the local population, now staging protests. However, regular terrorist attacks on the Shia of Quetta and Chinese workers in Balochistan signal “penetrations” that Pakistan can no longer tolerate. Unable to grasp the nettle, it keeps on hinting at the “Indian presence” in Afghanistan. With Khalilzad “helping” President Ghani in Kabul, Pakistan is going to find it difficult to “engage” with Afghanistan on the lines it is familiar with. Imran Khan is known to be a leader capable of taking tough decisions, but on the Taliban he has learned to be “flexible”. As head of its ruling party, he had to deal with the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa where the Taliban terrorists can kill at will; and has financially supported “religious schools” connected with the killers. His appeal to the Pakistani masses also rests on his pushback panache vis-a-vis the Americans. His first foreign policy tiff with the US has taken place. More will come as Kabul toughens its stance with help from Khalilzad who wrote in The Envoy (2016): “By the spring of 2003, Pakistan’s double game was undeniable… We had credible reports that it was providing money, arms, and training to insurgents who were crossing the border with impunity to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.” For all the latest  , download "
"September 8, 2018 12:30:45 am","Imagine that","SC dismisses plea to ban ‘Meesha’, making a case for creative autonomy of the author, carving out a new role for itself ","Editorials","In a country where creative impulses are more often than not suspect, which enjoys the dubious distinction of being the first to ban Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses, and whose government has peevishly declined to lift the ban for two decades, the protection of creative freedoms is always welcome news. But when Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra observed, while dismissing a plea for banning the Malayalam novel Meesha by S Hareesh, that creativity would perish if books were banned on flimsy allegations, and that requiring authors to “succumb to specifics” would be “tantamount to imposition”, he laid down a clear line which future PILs woud have to step over in order to be admitted. At the same time, there is another way in which the case marks a departure from convention. Article 19 of the Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of speech, lays down under sub-clause 2 that the state may impose “reasonable restrictions” in the interest of the “sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with other states, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.” It follows that it is the state, through its central or state governments, which performs the duty of banning and unbanning. Traditionally, courts have been petitioned to evaluate bans for constitutional validity — they enter the picture after the event. Now, this dismissal may be read as a precedent by which courts can be approached directly with a ban plea. Each case would necessarily be decided piecemeal on the merits of the text, and a rash of cases could bring further legal pressure to bear on authors. However, it is an open question whether that is a bad thing, since governments have proved to be fairly arbitrary in banning books, and are vulnerable to electoral considerations. If such cases are deemed to be matters of immediate public interest and decided expeditiously — like the Meesha matter, which jumped the queue — this might even bring quick relief. Besides, courts could exercise caution in admitting such PILs. The matter in question represented the interest of temple-going women, which is scarcely a well-defined section of the population. As the bench has observed, a ban “would create unrest and disquiet among the intelligentsia”. Indeed, the protection of the creative community is the responsibility of the court, as much as the protection of the freedoms of the general public. For all the latest  , download "
"September 8, 2018 2:16:56 am","Art of the deal","India-US dialogue shows a US more willing to address Delhi’s concerns, an India less diffident about transactional diplomacy  ","Editorials","Substantive results from the first ever “two-plus-two” dialogue between the foreign and defence ministers of India and the United States should pierce the political pessimism that had enveloped the narrative on Delhi’s ties with Washington. The signing of a new defence agreement called Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) — which has been pending for years — is only one signal that India’s defence establishment is rethinking its entrenched inhibitions about strengthening operational engagement with the American armed forces. After the talks, Delhi acknowledged its shared interests with Washington to the east of India and affirmed strong commitment to work closely with the US for regional security in bilateral, trilateral and quadrilateral formats. It also underlined the importance of financial sustainability of infrastructure development in the region. If India was less hesitant about working with the US in redressing the Asian imbalance resulting from China’s geopolitical assertiveness, Washington seemed more willing to address Delhi’s concerns on Pakistan. It demanded that the Pakistan Army stop using terror proxies and bring the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks to justice. It also agreed to step up counter-terror cooperation with India. The US is now ready to assist Delhi in the areas of defence innovation, support the development of defence industrial corridors and expand intelligence sharing as part of India’s new designation as a Major Defence Partner. As Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman put it, a “new era in bilateral defence and strategic engagement” has begun. As they celebrated the long overdue progress on the defence front, the two sides continued to discuss differences over trade, Russia and Iran. As with all of its commercial partners, the US is seeking a reduction of the trade surplus in India’s favour and improved market access. India, on its part, is trying to buy more from America and seeking a liberal regime on H1-B visas. The recent doubts over the relationship were centred around the consequences for India from the US decisions to impose new sanctions against Russia and Iran. Russia is a major strategic partner for India, Delhi would like to keep a working relationship with Iran. The US has softened its position from saying “no waivers” to suggesting that it was open to considering them in the case of India by taking into account the larger imperatives of the bilateral strategic partnership. This is an important reminder that the US, by nature, is open to splitting the difference and finding common ground with its partners. Indian diplomatic tradition, in contrast, has frowned upon deal-making. The successful first round of the “two plus two” talks suggests that Delhi is no longer diffident about transactional diplomacy. This is specially welcome when the man who invented the term “art of the deal”, Donald Trump, is the president of the United States. For all the latest  , download "
"September 8, 2018 12:17:20 am","Challenges for the next CJI","He will take over an under-funded and over-worked judiciary","Rekha Sharma","The press conference held by the four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court earlier this year, almost accusing the Chief Justice of India (CJI) of putting democracy in peril, is well known. They were particularly critical of the roster system and castigated the CJI for not being fair in allocating cases to his colleagues. A leading political party lost no time in initiating impeachment proceedings against the CJI, which added fuel to the fire. Against this background, doubts were raised over whether the government, which was seen by some to be siding with the CJI, would follow the line of succession in choosing his successor. The government’s spokesperson put the ball in the chief justice’s court. We were told that, as per convention, it is the CJI who recommends the name of his successor and the government goes by his recommendation. All eyes were thus set on the CJI. He has reportedly recommended the name of Justice Ranjan Gogoi, the senior-most judge after him, and by so doing has put to rest all speculation and misgivings. It is hoped that the government will act on his recommendation and appoint Justice Gogoi as the next C JI. Undoubtedly, the CJI while recommending Justice Gogoi’s name has set aside his personal sense of hurt and placed institutional interest above everything else. The CJI has done what was expected of him as the head of a responsible arm of the state. But given the background that preceded his decision, he deserves to be applauded. Whatever may have been the failings of the CJI, he did not deserve the treatment that was meted out to him, especially from his own. Now that Justice Gogoi — who was an active participant in the press conference — will in all probability step into the shoes of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, there is every reason to believe that he will address the issue of the roster, which troubled him and his colleagues so much. Justice Gogoi is known to be fiercely independent, upright and a no-nonsense man. We all hope that he will make the system more transparent with little or minimal scope for manipulation in the matter of allocation of cases to his colleague judges, and also keep in view their seniority. In the task ahead, he will need both empathy and imagination. Another issue that will require the urgent attention of the chief justice-designate is the mounting arrears of cases at all levels of the judicial hierarchy. Without going into the details, it is enough to point out that there are more than 3.3 crore cases pending in courts across the country, many of them for over 10 years. Given the pile of cases awaiting decisions, setting up more courts and appointing of more judges at all levels with supporting staff is the crying need of the hour. The judiciary represents the rule of law, which is the soul of any democracy and provides a shield to an ordinary citizen against the tyranny of the state and society. Hence, the need for a healthy, robust, vibrant and responsive judicial system. Unfortunately, the budget that is allocated to this important wing of the state is woefully inadequate to meet the needs and challenges facing the judiciary. In the financial year 2017-2018, the Union budget allocated a meagre Rs 1,744 crore to the judiciary, about 0.4 per cent of the total budget. Not very long ago, the then Chief Justice of India, T S Thakur, lamented the sorry state of affairs of the judiciary. Addressing a gathering in Vigyan Bhawan on April 24, 2016, Justice Thakur — who otherwise has a serene disposition — felt so helpless that he was driven to tears while imploring the government to address the issue. It will now be Justice Gogoi’s responsibility. Meanwhile, within the existing set of circumstances, let all stakeholders look for out-of-the-box solutions. For all the latest  , download "
"September 8, 2018 4:11:35 pm","Captain Uncool","Someone should calm Virat Kohli down and make him study the situation instead of screaming at it","Anil Dharker","“We made England earn their win.” That and similar other uncharacteristically modest statements formed the gist of  ’s post match press conference after the Fourth Test at Southampton. That merits a look at the record so far on this English tour: India lost by an innings at Lords, won handsomely at Trent Bridge, and lost the other two Tests by 31 and 60 runs. So, yes, Kohli is right in a sense. But the question to ask is: Should the Number One team in the world be satisfied just being combative? The danger is that losing “competitively” can become a habit: Remember the series in South Africa? Soon our cricketers will be back to their welcoming hearth and home, cuddle up to their bulging bank accounts and all will be forgotten. But if we really care about the game, serious soul-searching is required in matters both on and off the field in our cricket. Take off-the-field issues first. The Cricket Board is in a complete shambles. The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators, down to two members with zero experience of top level international cricket (one is a superannuated bureaucrat, the other a retired woman cricketer of another era), seems to be in no mood to give up its power. So who is to blame for the crazy tour scheduling? There was a fortnight’s gap between the short format internationals which started off this tour and the first Test. There was also an entire blank week between the third and fourth Tests. Yet only one, repeat one, three-day practice match was arranged (that too was cut down to two days because of weather). India could have played three games against counties before the first Test, and one after the Third Test, giving our cricketers exposure to English conditions, and also testing the team’s bench strength. Obvious? Not to our cricket administrators. Then there is the selection of the playing eleven, which goes from being whimsical to absurd. To recap, dropping Bhuvaneshwar Kumar after his incredible performance in the South Africa first Test and preferring   to   there; in England, dropping Cheteshwar Pujara in the first Test, to be topped by the ultimate idiocy of taking two spinners on a seaming track, and one spinner on a spinning pitch. This would be a huge joke if it weren’t for the fact that these ridiculous decisions probably cost India the series. Ravi Shastri has an astute cricketing brain. Has it been numbed by Virat Kohli’s much celebrated intensity? Cool and objective heads are needed for selection, and the time has come for curbing the captain’s powers in this important aspect of the game. The chief selector, accompanied by another member of the selection committee, should be on tour: The two of them, plus the coach and captain should select the playing eleven (with a casting vote for the chairman, just in case). A sensible selection committee would have long ago jettisoned the idea of playing only five batsmen, especially when it’s your batting that’s letting you down. Wouldn’t Karun Nair for Hardik Pandya have made eminent sense in the current series? However, the problem doesn’t end there. Let me say the unspeakable: Virat Kohli is a one-dimensional captain. Worse, he refuses to learn from his mistakes. The fact of the matter is, he doesn’t even know he makes mistakes. Some of them even a novice captain would avoid. Too much is made of Kohli’s passion and intensity on the field; in fact it’s obvious these cloud his judgement about important things like bowling changes and field placing. Joe Root doesn’t jump around and shout out loud to celebrate the fall of wickets; he is quiet because he is thinking and planning, qualities that seem alien to our captain. One can fill this whole page with examples of Kohli’s lack of tactical nous, but let’s look at just one example: Sam Curran, just 20, and batting at no 8 has scores of 24, 63, 40, 78 and 46 in this series, averaging 50.20. He has, single-handedly, taken the game away from India time and time again. But Kohli works in only one key, glorying in his own aggression. Why not, instead, go defensive when the situation calls for it? Pack one side with fielders; ask your fast bowlers to concentrate on that side of the wicket and out of frustration Curran will hole out. The question is, who will bell the cat named Virat Kohli? The only one who could do it is  . His cool head and sage advice would calm Kohli down and make him study the situation instead of screaming at it. Dhoni should never have been allowed to choose limited overs cricket over Tests: His finishing prowess in ODIs is, well, finished, but his wicket-keeping skills and steady batting would be just what’s needed for Test cricket. Even now, the selectors should speak to him. And while they are doing this, they should, at last, do justice to two brilliantly performing, but unfairly ignored, cricketers, Mayank Agarwal as an opener and Shreyas Iyer in the middle order. We want to win, dammit. Let other teams be competitive. For all the latest  , download "
"September 8, 2018 12:09:13 am","A law of its time","When it was enacted, Section 377 was lenient compared to its predecessors","Bibek Debroy","Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was actually liberal for its time. Before someone throws a fit, do note the qualification “for its time”. By now, everyone knows what Section 377 states. Even then, let me quote what it has to say on unnatural offences. “Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with (imprisonment for life), or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.” The IPC was enacted in 1860 and though other parts of it have been amended, Section 377 — till the Supreme Court verdict on Thursday — remained virtually what it statutorily was in 1860, apart from judicial interpretation. The only minor change, in 1955/56, was the replacement of “transportation for life” with “imprisonment for life”. The punishment was imprisonment, even it was for life. It wasn’t loss of life. Not surprisingly, Indian legislation then mirrored the English legislation of the time. England had the Offences against the Person Act of 1861 and Section 61 that criminalised sodomy and bestiality. Neither term was defined, at least not in the statute. The life imprisonment in these cases was not less than 10 years. Those English/British sections have been repealed and scrapped. Till Thursday, homosexuality was a crime in India, but that’s a different matter, important though it is. But what was the punishment for sodomy before 1861? Believe it or not, preceding versions of the 1861 law stipulated the death penalty. That’s why I said legislation enacted in India and England in the 1860s and 1880s meant transition to penal laws that were relatively liberal. Oscar Wilde and much later, Alan Turing, were fortunate that they were prosecuted after 1861. To be strictly accurate, though, both Wilde and Turing were prosecuted for gross indecency, not sodomy. Sodomy was difficult to prove. Moreover, with the death penalty, convictions were infrequent. So, in 1885, Britain introduced a Criminal Law Amendment Act with a slightly weaker crime of “gross indecency” and a reduced punishment of imprisonment “not exceeding two years” — not 10 years or life. That’s what Oscar Wilde got — hard labour between 1895 and 1897. As is well-known, Turing chose the non-imprisonment alternative. He opted for chemical castration, that is, oestrogen injections. In the debate on Section 377 in India, the value judgement implicit in the law has been interpreted as a jaundiced view on morality and a violation of the right to choose. It was indeed often so in India and Britain of the second half of the 19th century — the so-called Victorian era. When we look at a piece of legislation, we often look at the statute, as it is interpreted and viewed today, not as it was when first enacted. We also look at a piece of legislation and assume the objective stated is the real one. Before the changes in the 1860s and 1880s, England had the Buggery Act of 1833. “An Acte for the punishment of the vice of Buggerie”, passed by England’s Parliament when Henry VIII was the king. This act was repealed for a brief period during Queen Mary’s reign. But the legislation was introduced again by Elizabeth I. Thomas Cromwell, obviously before he was beheaded, piloted Henry VIII’s legislation through Parliament. It’s good to have a quote, even though the English is archaic. “The offenders being hereof convicted by verdict confession or outlawry shall suffer such pains of death and losses and penalties of their good chattels debts land tenements and hereditaments as felons do according to the Common Laws of this Realm. And that no person offending in any such offence shall be admitted to his Clergy.” Buggery/sodomy wasn’t defined. But no matter. Was this about morality? Nothing of the kind. Read that archaic English carefully. Once convicted, the accused lost his/her life. But he/she lost all possessions too, especially land. The heirs didn’t get it, the Crown did. Monks and nuns could also be prosecuted for this particular crime, though they couldn’t be prosecuted for murder. Why did Queen Mary briefly repeal the law between 1553 and 1563? Because she wanted ecclesiastical courts to try such crimes. Why did Henry VIII introduce the law? Because he didn’t want ecclesiastical courts to try such crimes. He wanted to go after monks/nuns and the enormous quantities of land the monasteries possessed. The objective, implicit if not explicit, was economic, not moral. It was no different for what was done against the Knight Templars in Europe. That’s why I said the apparent objective of a piece of legislation can be quite different from the real one. “But this I know, that every Law/That men have made for Man,/Since first Man took his brother’s life,/And the sad world began,/But straws the wheat and saves the chaff/With a most evil fan.” This is from The Ballad of Reading Goal. Like the law criminalising homosexuality, we should repeal all pieces of legislation that are irrelevant. For all the latest  , download "
"September 7, 2018 3:21:04 pm","I am part of the Resistance in the Trump Administration","I work for the president but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations","New York Times","President Trump is facing a test to his presidency unlike any faced by a modern American leader. It’s not just that the special counsel looms large. Or that the country is bitterly divided over Mr Trump’s leadership. Or even that his party might well lose the House to an opposition hellbent on his downfall. The dilemma — which he does not fully grasp — is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations. I would know. I am one of them. To be clear, ours is not the popular “resistance” of the left. We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous. But we believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic. That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office. The root of the problem is the president’s amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making. Although he was elected as a Republican, the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives: Free minds, free markets and free people. At best, he has invoked these ideals in scripted settings. At worst, he has attacked them outright. In addition to his mass-marketing of the notion that the press is the “enemy of the people,” President Trump’s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic. Don’t get me wrong. There are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: Effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more. But these successes have come despite — not because of — the president’s leadership style, which is impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective. From the White House to executive branch departments and agencies, senior officials will privately admit their daily disbelief at the commander in chief’s comments and actions. Most are working to insulate their operations from his whims. Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back. “There is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next,” a top official complained to me recently, exasperated by an Oval Office meeting at which the president flip-flopped on a major policy decision he’d made only a week earlier. The erratic behaviour would be more concerning if it weren’t for unsung heroes in and around the White House. Some of his aides have been cast as villains by the media. But in private, they have gone to great lengths to keep bad decisions contained to the West Wing, though they are clearly not always successful. It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognise what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won’t. The result is a two-track presidency. Take foreign policy: In public and in private, President Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied, like-minded nations. Astute observers have noted, though, that the rest of the administration is operating on another track, one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly, and where allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals. On Russia, for instance, the president was reluctant to expel so many of Mr Putin’s spies as punishment for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. He complained for weeks about senior staff members letting him get boxed into further confrontation with Russia, and he expressed frustration that the United States continued to impose sanctions on the country for its malign behaviour. But his national security team knew better — such actions had to be taken, to hold Moscow accountable. This isn’t the work of the so-called deep state. It’s the work of the steady state. Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over. The bigger concern is not what Mr Trump has done to the presidency but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility. Senator John McCain put it best in his farewell letter. All Americans should heed his words and break free of the tribalism trap, with the high aim of uniting through our shared values and love of this great nation. We may no longer have Senator McCain. But we will always have his example — a lodestar for restoring honour to public life and our national dialogue. Mr Trump may fear such honourable men, but we should revere them. There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first. But the real difference will be made by everyday citizens rising above politics, reaching across the aisle and resolving to shed the labels in favour of a single one: Americans.

"September 7, 2018 6:44:26 am","A victory, a new battle","As a minority, we continue to fight for freedom, and to keep the freedom won","Harish Iyer","There is an unusual sense of calm around me even as my phone incessantly rings and WhatsApp forwards flow in at the speed of light. There is din around me, there is a quiet within me. Guess this is how freedom feels. I have felt like this before, in 2009, after the Delhi High Court verdict on Section 377, which in effect decriminalised consensual sexual acts between adults in private. Somewhere, I assumed that the taste of freedom was absolute. Come 2013, life reminded me that it was not. The Supreme Court set aside the Delhi High Court judgement by Justice AP Shah and put the ball in Parliament’s court to decide the fate of individuals the court dubbed as a “minuscule minority”. We were worthy only of ridicule when a parliamentarian,  , made two attempts to invite the interest of the House for a discussion. Even voices that supported us were called gay, as though it is some kind of a swear word. We finally had to take our battle back to the courts. Like a football, we were passed between court and Parliament. The apex court was our last hope. Five petitioners joined in, and then several others, to work against this law of inhumanity. And while definitely late, we have our freedom back. After basking in the glory of my new-found wings, I have some questions that need answers: Who is the state to take my freedom away in the first place? Isn’t it supposed to ensure our civil liberties? Why am I unequal? Why should I find a valid “reason” for being queer? Why is there a need, despite being born with queerdom, to prove the existence of the queer gene? Why does the world deliberate on my sex life and find nothing unethical in questioning my ethics of love? These are questions that should be answered by those we voted to power. Instead, they are the ones who have pushed us in into deep corners of shame. Let us mince no words when saying this — our courts did the job brilliantly because our parliamentarians did not. Barring a minuscule minority, they either skirted the issue or simply joined the voices of ridicule. We have had Subramanian Swamy who thought that homosexuality is a mental disorder.   said he wouldn’t support unnatural homosexuality. Sushma Swaraj said gay people cannot avail of surrogacy because homosexuality is against the Indian ethos. Yogi Adityanath said it is an unnatural act and cannot be supported. 
It is a pity that we had to consider it a “softened stance” and a “positive message” when Dattatreya Hosabale from the RSS said “no criminalisation, but no glorification either”. What do we glorify, we who simply live our truth? The Congress, the grand old party of India could also have had Section 377 read down to decriminalise all acts of consensual sex between adults. They did nothing concrete. It was only when they were losing the 2014 elections that they came out vociferously in support of decriminalisation. There were those like Milind Deora and   who spoke about Section 377 as early as the mid-2000s. However, their voice was not given the importance it deserved. 
I also need to acknowledge that the CPM has been unwavering in its support, as has the BJD and Anbumani Ramadoss of the PMK. Activists like Anjali Gopalan and Ashok Row Kavi have put in years of work for our rights, and lawyers like Anand Grover of the Lawyers Collective have toiled to bring us the freedom we enjoy. Everyone who put their name in the application in front of the Supreme Court, without worrying about the consequences needs a special mention — the eloquence of advocate Menaka Guruswamy and other lawyers fighting the case, and the understanding of the esteemed five-member bench have all won the case. This is the first of many battles. The fight for equality for any minority is a life-long one. Either we fight for freedom, or we fight to keep the freedom we have won. But I am tired of fighting. I want to rest, with the assurance that you will not take my freedom away. Will you make that promise? For all the latest  , download "
"September 7, 2018 6:43:10 am","Freedom’s second coming","Supreme Court verdict on Section 377 will spark many more challenges to inequality, discrimination","Anand Grover","Today is an historic day for India. The Supreme Court has decriminalised sex between consenting adults in private under Section 377. With the judgment of the Supreme Court today, we, Indians, have attained a second azadi for those who have continued to be persecuted after Independence by the law enacted by the British in 1861. It has freed the LGBTQI communities from the yoke of a colonial law. This will usher in a new inclusive India which is the need of hour. This is a profound change. The LGBTQI communities can walk tall and openly with their heads proud and held high as equal citizens with dignity, liberty and fraternity. This will open new vistas for other challenges and opportunities, which will be welcome. A lot of people have waited a long time for this day. It has come at last. Victory could not have been sweeter than this after years of struggle and after many setbacks. Though the wait was a long one, from 2001. But it has been well worth it, with all its ups and downs. It all started in the offices of the Lawyers Collective in Mumbai after the great victory in the HIV field, that magnificent judgment of Justice VP Tipnis in Mx Of Bombay Indian Inhabitant vs M/S. Zy And Another (1997). That verdict directed that all HIV positive persons who were functionally fit to do the work could not be denied a job in the state or public sector. The judgment received a great deal of publicity and soon gay men were knocking on the doors of the Lawyers Collective office. We realised fairly quickly that the bane of most of their complaints — stigma, discrimination and blackmail by the police of dating partners — arose from Section 377. The availability and accessibility of services for HIV was impeded and young gay men were reportedly subjected to conversion therapy by their families We decided that Section 377 should be challenged. Naz Foundation filed the writ petition in the Delhi High Court through the legal team at the Lawyers Collective. It was dismissed by the Delhi High Court on the ground of maintainability. In the challenge to that order, the Supreme Court firmly said that the matter must be decided on merits and not technicalities. Soon, other groups joined the fray with Naz Foundation in the Delhi High Court. Others opposing us also put in their might — they were of the view that HIV had nothing to do with gay rights. The Government of India filed contradictory affidavits — the Health Ministry supported the petition and the Home Ministry opposed it. Ultimately, the Delhi High Court, in a seminal judgment in Naz Foundation, pronounced the decriminalisation of sex between consenting adults in private. Well reasoned and deep in understanding, it liberated the LGBTQI communities from a colonial era law. Unfortunately, the euphoria of the high court verdict was short lived because the Supreme Court in Suresh Kumar Koushal vs Naz Foundation trumped it. But the Koushal judgment was short-sighted, narrow and unreasoned in its approach. We wrote a large number of articles that Koushal was wrong and it was bound to be set aside. Of course, we filed review petitions, which were dismissed. Then we filed curative petitions, which are still pending. The first blow to Koushal came with the NALSA vs Union of India (2014) judgment. Carefully written, and without overstepping its jurisdiction (as it sidestepped Koushal), it granted gender recognition on a self-identification basis to the transgender communities. That was one wicket down in a three-wicket match. The other wicket fell with the privacy judgment of KS Puttaswamy vs Union of India and Others (2017). The Supreme Court, through judgments authored by different judges, held that the treatment of privacy in Koushal was wrong. The second wicket was down. Now, only the final wicket had to be taken. Victory was, thus, a foregone conclusion. The questions asked by the judges in the Supreme Court in Navtej Johar vs Union of India only confirmed this. The verdict of the Supreme Court, therefore, is not unexpected. But it is a watershed moment in our history. In the historic verdict, the Court emphasised the many strands that make up India, the centrality of individual freedom, reaffirming that old adage, “unity in diversity”. It will throw up several challenges on equality and discrimination. Suppressed for a long time, the LGBTQI communities in India will demand their rightful share in all spheres of life. Not only in employment, but in education and services and all other spaces, both in the public and, especially, the private sector, for which there is no law at the moment. That journey will shape new lives for all citizens. Similarly, the law on rape is inadequate to address non-consensual sex other than within the binary of man-woman sex. Such is also the case with sexual harassment. These apart, there will be the demand for a same sex marriage law. Though that may take time, as it has in many other countries, a civil partnership law can easily be brought in as an interim measure. For all the latest  , download "

","Editorial","While the level of the Yamuna waters in around the national capital is receding at the rate of one centimetre per hour, the threat to six lakh people living in Shahdara and neighbouring colonies across the river continues to be serious. The people were once again warned to be ready to move to safe places at short notice as the swollen river lashed against vulnerable points of the two embankments protecting these colonies. The army was called out once again to carry out an emergency operation to plug seepages at various paints and raise the height of the Shadara bund. This was necessary because the swift currents of the river had eroded the inner side of the bund. The army moved out after accomplishing the task. Chaos prevails at the hurriedly put together relief camps. They are already overcrowded with as many as 15 persons in one tent or room, and more are streaming in every hour with the few odd belongings — usually a charpoy, a trunk and a few utensils. The Delhi Administration seems to have forgotten about some of the smaller camps, which have sprung up over the last 24 hours. In some of these, there is not even one official to organise basic amenities for the victims. The police confirmed the involvement of Billa and his accomplice Ranga in the abduction and murder of Geeta and Sanjay Chopra. They had come to this conclusion on the basis of the evidence, including the fingerprints lifted by the scientists of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory from the Fiat car, which was found abandoned in Adarsh Nagar. The once sleepy village of Naun, about 100 km from Shimla, was the abode of at least 60 people. Now it exists only in the revenue records. A cloud burst washed away the whole village except a solitary room that was left standing amidst the rubble. When a Press party reached this village, it looked like a valley of death.

"September 7, 2018 12:15:29 am","Inside job","NYT carries an unsigned oped by a Trump staffer, and POTUS is fit to be tied. A new face-off is here","Editorial","A resistance worker within the Trump administration, actuated by the principle of putting the nation before all else, has written an anonymous oped in the New York Times, a newspaper that Trump execrates. The author, a senior official, claims to be part of a group within Trump’s team “working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.” He alleges that Trump has no patience for the fundamental conservative ideals: “Free minds, free markets and free people”. In fact, he can demonise the press precisely because he is innocent of these convictions. In terms of inclination, the author fears that Trump has neither a moral compass nor a policy direction, and his decision-making frequently mimics the operation of a windshield wiper. In sum, his behaviour inspires “daily disbelief” among his staff. Now, none of this is headline news. The world — and especially the European Union and Nato — has enough experiential evidence to have arrived at those conclusions independently. But the testimony of someone who works closely with Trump, in what he calls a “two-track presidency”, is strangely compelling. And appearing on the heels of Bob Woodward’s unflattering narrative of the Trump presidency, the oped has had a powerful effect. Especially since it seems less a rant and more a countdown: The underground is apparently keeping America safe from the president’s worst instincts until he is out of power. This is prophecy, rather than protest. Trump is epidermally underequipped. One withering tweet from JK Rowling can set him off with the force of Krakatoa. What do you bet that in one corner of the Oval Office, an AI is running a textual analysis of that oped to identify the author, so that Trump can sack him?

"September 7, 2018 12:15:25 am","The long road to equality","SC’s Section 377 verdict brings a belated but soaring moment. It’s a victory for individual and minority rights, underlines primacy of Constitution as a transformative document","Editorial","Section 377 IPC is irrational, indefensible and arbitrary,” the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday while striking down a law that had oppressed India’s LGBT community for more than 150 years. What consenting adults do in their bedrooms is no longer the business of the state. “The sexual orientation of each individual in the society must be protected on an even platform, for the right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution,” the five-judge bench ruled. That, in itself, makes the verdict historic. But the judgment must also be celebrated for tying the issue of sexual freedom with questions of minority rights, the protection of which is essential in any system that calls itself a constitutional democracy. “Constitutional rights cannot be held hostage to majoritarian consensus and popular morality,” said the apex court. While striking down Section 377, the five-judge bench delineated the law’s discriminatory character. “Section 377 IPC assumes the characteristic of unreasonableness, for it becomes a weapon in the hands of the majority to seclude, exploit and harass the LGBT community. It shrouds the lives of the LGBT community in criminality and constant fear mars their joy of life. They constantly face social prejudice, disdain and are subjected to the shame of being their very natural selves.” The judgment then tries to locate homosexuality “as a matter of identity”. “Attitudes and mentality have to change to accept the distinct identity of individuals and respect them for who they are rather than compelling them to become who they are not,” the five-judge bench notes. It quotes scientific research to show that the behaviour is “as much ingrained, inherent and innate as heterosexuality”. In doing so, the bench makes a strong case for the rights of the individual. “The LGBT community possess the same human, fundamental and constitutional rights as other citizens do since these rights inhere in individuals as natural and human rights. Respect for individual choice is the very essence of liberty under law”. Thursday’s verdict is in line with the apex court’s recent inclination to subject some of its past verdicts to scrutiny — this was most noticeable in last year’s ruling on the privacy issue. In fact, a major portion of that landmark verdict was devoted to Section 377. The court had weighed its 2013 ruling that resuscitated Section 377 against the Delhi High Court’s verdict of 2009 that decriminalised homosexuality and had come out in support of the latter. “Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual,” it said. In a fundamental sense, the verdict that reads down the colonial-era law is an affirmation of the principles that underlay the privacy verdict. “The mere fact that the percentage of population whose fundamental right to privacy is being abridged by the existence of Section 377 in its present form is low does not impose a limitation upon this Court from protecting the fundamental rights of those who are so affected by this Section,” the court has said. Its words, “The constitutional framers could have never intended that the protection of fundamental rights was only for the majority population,” while intended as a critique of its 2013 judgment, have resonance beyond this case. In fact, the court notes that the “struggles of citizens belonging to sexual minorities is the struggle against various forms of social subordination. This includes various forms of transgression such as inter-caste and inter-community relationships, which are sought to be curbed by society. What links LGBT individuals to couples who love across caste and community lines is the fact that both are exercising their right to love at enormous personal risk and in the process disrupting existing lines of social authority”. The battle against Section 377 has politicised generations of activists, influenced popular culture, sparked public discussion and debates — within the LGBT community as well — and raised awareness around sexuality and gender-related issues. Thursday’s verdict acknowledges this socio-political context: “The challenge to Section 377 has to be understood from the perspective of a rights discourse. While doing so, it becomes necessary to understand the constitutional source from which the claim emerges. When a right is claimed to be constitutionally protected, it is but necessary for the court to analyse the basis of that assertion”. The richness of the verdict lies in the way the five judges link their understanding of the discriminatory nature of Section 377 with the role of the Constitution as “a transformative document”. “Our Constitution is a living and organic document capable of expansion with the changing needs and demands of the society”. The verdict calls upon courts to “act as sentinel on qui vive for guarding the rights of all individuals”. CJI Dipak Misra, introduced the verdict with a call to “vanish, prejudice and embrace inclusion and ensure equal rights”. The judiciary has, time and again, proved it is up to the task. In the case of Section 377, it has been supported enthusiastically by civil society, more reluctantly by the political class, to deliver a much belated but historic reform.

"September 9, 2018 1:47:48 am","Across the Aisle: Black to white magic","RBI had done no study or preparatory work; yet the Central Board of RBI hurriedly met on November 8, without an agenda and without a background note, and dutifully “recommended” that the notes may be declared no longer legal tender.","P Chidambaram","Demonetisation is done but not yet dusted. With the release of the RBI’s Annual Report for 2017-18, the ghost of demonetisation has come back to haunt the government of Mr  . A policy may be well-intended, yet flawed. In the case of demonetisation it is difficult to believe that the policy was well-intended because of the opaque process that was followed before the decision was announced. On November 7, 2016, the government told RBI to send its recommendation on the proposed demonetisation of currency (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes) by the next day. RBI had done no study or preparatory work; yet the Central Board of RBI hurriedly met on November 8, without an agenda and without a background note, and dutifully “recommended” that the notes may be declared no longer legal tender. The Chief Economic Adviser was not consulted or taken into confidence: on November 8 he was in Kerala to deliver a talk. A Note for Cabinet was not prepared and circulated to the Cabinet or tabled at the Cabinet meeting held on November 8. Ministers who were present have admitted, privately, that they were “told” at the meeting that currency will be demonetised. Nevertheless, let me assume that the decision to demonetise currency was taken with the intention of achieving certain objectives — seizing black money, ending counterfeiting of currency notes and stopping the financing of terrorism. None of the objectives has been achieved: hoards of black (i.e. unaccounted) money in new currency notes continue to be seized; counterfeit currency in the new denominations and design continue to be detected; and terrorism continues unabated and is presumably financed by new currency notes. In the light of the failed objectives, what should the people conclude on demonetisation? I shall reserve my conclusion for the end and look at one important outcome of demonetisation — its impact on saving, especially household saving. According to the RBI, currency in circulation on October 28, 2016 (before demonetisation) was of the value of Rs 17,54,022 crore. On August 17, 2018, the currency in circulation was Rs 19,17,129 crore! So, we are not a less-cash economy because of demonetisation. How is this currency in circulation accounted for? For the answer, see Table 1.   1. The people of India trust cash. They are keeping more cash with them today than in 2015-16. The amount of cash in hand has actually doubled from 1.4 to 2.8 per cent. Consequently, cash in the form of deposits with banks has declined from 4.6 to 2.9 per cent. 2. People have borrowed more and their liabilities have increased from 2.8 to 4 per cent. As a result, while the gross household saving is higher, the net household saving has declined from 8.1 to 7.1 per cent. 3. The fall in net household saving has impacted investment measured by Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and its components: see Table 2. 4. The fall in GFCF naturally affected the growth rate since demonetisation. It is too early to celebrate the 2018-19 Q1 growth rate of 8.2 per cent because it is on the lowest base of 5.6 per cent recorded in 16 quarters since the NDA came to power. Going forward, the ‘base effect’ will not be so favourable. Hence, even if the economy maintains its current pace of growth, the quarterly growth rate is likely to slide in the next three quarters.   Given these facts, it is amusing to see the government’s spokespersons inventing new arguments to flaunt the ‘success’ of demonetisation. The favourite argument is that the tax base has increased. True, a record 5.42 crore income tax returns have been filed in the current year. But, remember that 1 crore filers return ‘nil’ tax liability and pay no income tax! Besides, the increase in direct tax revenue is only 6.6 per cent against a budgeted increase of 14.4 per cent. There is also the pie-in-the-sky argument: thousands of suspicious accounts and transactions are under scrutiny. Good, but when will the process, including appeals and further appeals, be completed? The government is counting its chicken before they are hatched. Meanwhile, the public perception is that tax terrorism has been unleashed upon individuals and businesses. The next argument is rapid digitisation. Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the value of digital transactions has increased annually at 14.3, 10.7, 9.1, 24.4 and 12 per cent, indicating no acceleration in the pace because of demonetisation. Moreover, digitisation has been achieved in other countries without the disruption and pain of demonetisation and could have been achieved in India too. At the end of the day, after being told that Rs 15,31,000 crore has been returned to the RBI, the general perception is that demonetisation was an ingenious device to facilitate a number of people to convert their black money into white money through a simple over-the-counter exchange at banks!

"September 9, 2018 11:29:27 am","Fifth Column: A false narrative","The essence of the new narrative is that Modi has ‘destroyed’ the institutions of democracy and that if he gets a second term he will make sure elections are never held again.","Tavleen Singh"," has made mistakes since he became Prime Minister. Serious ones. And, this column has not hesitated to point them out. But, what I refuse to do is become party to the new narrative of lies being spread by a cabal of leftists, liberals and disgruntled ex-BJP ministers that speaks loudest in the public square. This mostly leftist cabal has had control of the megaphone since 1947, but has used it most effectively in the past four years. The megaphone gets louder by the day now that Modi is seen to be weaker politically than before. The essence of the new narrative is that Modi has ‘destroyed’ the institutions of democracy and that if he gets a second term he will make sure elections are never held again. These doomsayers appear to have forgotten that this was tried once before by   and despite press censorship and the suspension of all fundamental rights she could not sustain her dictatorship beyond two years. Luckily for us India is made up of many states, the people of which speak in many tongues. Very rarely do they fight in the same revolution. It is important to remember that after the Emergency the southern states voted for Mrs Gandhi because the effects of the Emergency were not felt there as much as they were in north India. Now let us examine how many institutions of democracy Modi has succeeded in ‘destroying’ since 2014. Parliament. He is the first Prime Minister in 30 years to have won a full majority and yet it is the Congress party with its handful of MPs who have controlled Parliament’s functioning. If it has seemed mostly non-functional for four years it is because this party’s 44 MPs have made it so. Notice that almost the only time there has been relative quiet in the Lok Sabha was on the day that the Congress President performed his hug and wink charade. So Modi cannot be blamed for not preventing debate on vital laws. The judiciary. Personally I agree with Fali Nariman, the Supreme Court’s eminence grise, when he says that the day four senior judges called a press conference was a truly black day. Had they gone public to explain why it takes decades for justice to be done in India even in cases of terrorism, murder and rape, they would have deserved a standing ovation. Instead they chose to go public only to complain about not being allowed to decide which judges should be on which bench, while admitting that this was definitely the Chief Justice’s prerogative. That press conference diminished the Supreme Court but the judges were hailed as shining heroes by the cabal described in paragraph one. The Executive. According to the new narrative Modi is so authoritarian that he does not consult his ministers on matters of grave importance such as national security and the economy. It is his prerogative to consult or not. But, he has not complained when he has been personally blamed for demonetisation and for implementing GST badly. He did not complain when Rahul Gandhi accused him of using demonetisation to ‘steal’ the people’s money only to give it to a ‘handful of his rich friends.’ Nor has he protested when lynchings by cow vigilantes have been blamed on him personally. The media. He has not held a single press conference or given a single real interview since he became Prime Minister and this has harmed him more than it has harmed the media. I hear from colleagues that they have been called up and threatened when they have written a story that shows the government in a bad light. I have also heard that some editors lost their jobs because of their political views but I also hear every day on television and in the newspapers many, many personal attacks on the Prime Minister. On social media BJP trolls are so partisan and foolishly abusive that it’s clear that Modi’s supposedly sinister social media cell is staggeringly incompetent. The final charge against Modi is that he is weakening democracy by appointing Hindutva types to positions of importance in universities and other educational institutions. Well, is he going to appoint those people instead who openly call him a fascist? University campuses have been bastions of not just the Left but of the extreme Left ever since I went to college 40 years ago. If there are new voices today on campuses it should be considered a welcome change. It is worth remembering that when   was prime minister similar complaints were made against his HRD Minister all the time. His efforts to paint ancient Hindu India as a place where beef was never eaten were publicly mocked. That is as far as he got with erasing history. More proof that a false narrative always gets found out. For all the latest  , download "
"September 9, 2018 1:44:04 am","Out of my Mind: A grave danger","While the Supreme Court came through with flying colours with its verdict on Section 377, it did something in the week before which has hardly been remarked upon. ","Meghnad Desai","The Supreme Court has struck a blow for freedom and equality by getting rid of 377 which was a peculiarly horrid Victorian law making people live false lives. There is nothing in Indian culture, no matter how far back you go, which disapproved of, let alone criminalised homosexuality. We need to examine the Indian Penal Code line by line and bring it in line with 21st century values of dignity and mutual respect across all identities that people may adopt. The Victorian, colonial State that we inherited but never fully rejected needs to be removed from lives of all Indians. But while the Supreme Court came through with flying colours in this case, it did something in the week before which has hardly been remarked upon. The Court ruled that someone from outside a state is not eligible to claim reservation granted by the state. When a state grants reservations they are only for ‘citizens’ of the state and not outsiders. This strikes a crippling blow at the idea of a single citizenship for all Indians. No matter whether ‘insiders’ or ‘outsiders’, Indians should be free to live and work and enjoy reservations they qualify for, all across India. The Honourable Supreme Court’s decision means that only the upper castes who are not entitled to reservations (and the non-Hindus) are able to enjoy the rights of mobility across India without paying a cost. Reservations are a handicap for the ‘reserved’ if granted by the state and not the Centre. In other words, state reservations are not open to all Indians. This is a very serious matter with long-run consequences that could change the nature of the Indian Union. The conduct of the   in Assam has already raised the notion that to live, work and vote in Assam you have to show you were born in Assam (speaking Assamese an advantage) or you have proof of long residence. It is obvious that to conduct NRC is to qualify and reduce the idea of an all Indian citizenship. The new judgment drives another nail in the rights of OBC citizens. It would be easy to be complacent. What do us lay people know about the higher intricacies of the Constitution and why not just let the Supreme Court deal with it. But the idea implicit in the judgment is that state reservations are for state ‘citizens’ and not ‘outsiders’. The next step will be to extend that to all government jobs. A few years ago Rahul Gandhi decried the UP government (obviously non-Congress because Congress has not been in power for a couple of decades in UP) for the fact that young people from UP had migrated to Maharashtra for jobs. Where were UP jobs for UP boys? The   agrees with him.

The economic stagnation of the first 40 years and the patchy employment creation during the next 30 have elevated reservations for government jobs as a panacea.

"September 9, 2018 1:24:37 am","Inside Track: Vanishing line","The BJP high command and the PMO have been pressing the chief ministers of BJP- ruled states to furnish statistics of the beneficiaries of different Central and state government schemes at the state, district, block and village level.","Coomi Kapoor","The BJP high command and the PMO have been pressing the chief ministers of BJP- ruled states to furnish statistics of the beneficiaries of different Central and state government schemes at the state, district, block and village level. The data has to include   numbers, addresses and mobile numbers, if any. Among the 23 schemes, some of them repackaged and fast tracked, are: Ujjawala, MGNREGA, Jan Dhan and Direct Benefit Transfer. The government wants updated data till October 1. It is speculated that the information is being compiled so that PM Modi can mention names of beneficiaries when he visits a particular region. The states have also been asked to prepare a chart with precise dates on which the beneficiaries received the benefits. This second round of data collection will start in January and is to be completed by February 15. This suggests that the government does not plan to advance the Lok Sabha elections and also that the line between government and party has virtually vanished. Ever since the Prime Minister met popular Malayalam film actor Mohanlal, it is speculated that the BJP hopes to persuade him to stand as its candidate from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency next year. Thiruvananthapuram is one Kerala constituency which the BJP had set its sights on for decades. But its candidate, the dogged O Rajagopal lost repeatedly, his vote tally far behind the two main contestants, the Congress and the CPI. But in 2014 the BJP voteshare shot up by 20 per cent and Rajagopal, now 88, lost to the Congress’s   by a mere two per cent of the votes and emerged second. Modi tweeted after his interaction with Mohanlal waxing eloquent about the actor’s humility and social services. The actor had called on Modi to invite him for a programme to his Viswa Santhi Foundation, but has disavowed any political ambitions. Rahul Gandhi has formed three major committees for the 2019 polls. The core committee, the manifesto committee and the publicity committee. While veterans such as Ahmed Patel, Anand Sharma, Ghulam Nabi Azad, P Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh have been included, Kapil Sibal was left out. The leading lawyer does not just represent most Congress leaders in major court cases, but he has considerable clout in other parties, since he is the legal counsel for party bosses such as Lalu Prasad and  . Sibal was kept out of all three panels because of internal party politics. After belated realisation of the lacuna, Sibal was added to the publicity committee, but he declined the position. Actually Sibal’s just released book Shades of Truth can be an excellent reference source for any Congress publicity material for the forthcoming polls. Jignesh Mevani, Alpesh Thakor and Hardik Patel are positioning themselves for a greater say in the distribution of Congress tickets in next year’s general elections. Hardik has gone on fast for his demand for quota reservation for Patels. Though he has lost much weight and has written out his will, Congress cadres are not overly enthused by his campaign. (Incidentally when Medha Patkar tried to meet Hardik, she was turned away by his supporters who felt she was anti- Gujarat for opposing the Narmada dam). Hardik wants to contest from Mehsana and is expected to win. Mevani, though not in the Congress, wants the ticket from Bhuj, a reserved constituency. If Rahul Gandhi obliges the rest of the party is likely to be up in arms. Unlike the other two, Alpesh, the Congress MLA from Radhanpur, does not have national ambitions but has dreams of emerging as CM of Gujarat. He wants a definite say in ticket distribution. Ratnakar Pandey was a familiar figure in Congress circles from 1985 to 1991 as the faithful standard bearer for the Gandhi family. Pandey along with Suresh Pachauri, SS Ahluwalia and Baba Mishra were known as the shouting brigade in the Rajya Sabha. They would stand up and scream whenever any opposition MP criticised then PM  , particularly on Bofors. After Rajiv’s death, Pandey, who claimed he helped Sonia learn Hindi, was at the forefront in the campaign to install Sonia as party head. His sycophancy was such that he once declared that if Sonia needed slippers he was happy to contribute his skin to make them. Last week, Pandey passed away almost unnoticed by his party. Sonia did not issue a statement and Rahul did not tweet condolences. Raj Babbar was instructed belatedly to send out a message of commiseration. For all the latest  , download "
"September 8, 2018 6:56:20 am","Rights over wrong","With Section 377 verdict, SC emphasises dynamic nature of Constitution, its counter-majoritarian role","Arundhati Katju","The Constitution Bench judgment in Navtej Singh Johar and Others v Union of India is a watershed moment in Indian constitutional jurisprudence. While the judgment has extended the cloak of constitutional protection to LGBT citizens, it has relevance to all minorities and indeed to all individuals. The judgment articulates a vision of constitutional supremacy that will guide Indian democracy well into the future. It protects LGBT citizens under the right to equality, along with privacy and dignity. Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice AM Khanwilkar’s judgment puts the individual, and, as they poetically call it, the “overarching ideals of individual autonomy and liberty”, at the heart of the constitutional scheme. In the Chief Justice’s words, “Destruction of individual identity would tantamount to crushing of intrinsic dignity that cumulatively encapsulates the values of privacy, choice, and freedom of speech and other expressions.” In Johar’s vision, individual identity is constitutionally protected. It is this focus on the individual that leads Johar to overturn Suresh Kumar Koushal vs Naz Foundation (2013). The court has emphatically held that fundamental rights do not hinge on the number of people who claim them. Koushal’s reasoning that Section 377 should not be struck down because LGBT people constitute a “minuscule minority” has been put to rest in Johar. The Constitution doesn’t just protect minorities, the individual is the basic unit of the constitutional scheme. The court has thus reiterated its commitment to its counter-majoritarian role. Further, the court has emphasised the dynamic nature of constitutional interpretation and indeed of the Constitution itself. Constitutional courts breathe life into the Constitution through their dynamic and purposive interpretation of the constitutional text. This dynamic interpretation ensures that the Constitution endures across generations. But, as the judgment notes, dynamic interpretation is also essential to enable transformative constitutionalism. Citing NM Thomas, Chief Justice Misra recalls that the Indian Constitution is a “great social document, Supreme Court calls the Constitution of India a great social document, almost revolutionary in its aim of transforming a medieval, hierarchical society into a modern, egalitarian democracy”. The very purpose of constitutionalism is to transform society. Dynamic constitutional interpretation allows for the progressive realisation of rights as societies evolve. Johar also builds on the Supreme Court’s right to choice jurisprudence. Starting with Common Cause v Union of India, the court held that choice was constitutionally protected under Article 21 of the Constitution. The right to choice was extended to the choice of partner under  ’s case and the khap panchayat’s judgment. Now, with Johar, the Supreme Court has extended the right to choice to LGBT persons. The court has, finally, struck down Section 377 because it violates Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. Performing its classic function of judicial review, the court has struck down Section 377 as being violative of Articles 14 and 15. Justice Nariman has rightly begun Johar’s equality analysis with the landmark judgment, Anuj Garg v Hotel Association of India, where Justice SB Sinha emphasised the need for dynamic constitutional interpretation in cases concerning gender equality. Justices Misra and Khanwilkar found that Section 377 has no constitutionally valid object inasmuch as non-consensual acts criminalised under Section 377 have already been made penal offences under Section 375 IPC. They have also found Section 377 IPC to be arbitrary because it criminalises sexual acts between adults who are competent to give their consent, and puts undue limitations on their liberty. Crucially, Justices DY Chandrachud and  , in their concurring opinions, have also found that Section 377 violates Article 15’s prohibition against sex discrimination, specifically noting that “sex” under Article 15 includes “sexual orientation”. Justice Chandrachud has also relied on Anuj Garg to reiterate that Article 15 rejects discrimination based on sex-based stereotypes. Reading these opinions together, the Constitution’s entire equality code has been extended to LGBT persons. This is a groundbreaking jurisprudential development. In Justice Chandrachud’s words, the Johar case “is about an aspiration to realise constitutional rights… Article 14 contains a powerful statement of values — of the substance of equality before the law and the equal protection of laws.” The court’s emphasis on equality helps LGBT citizens realise these rights in full. Justice Malhotra has also noted that relationships between same-sex couples have been accorded protection across the world. Chief Justice Misra has protected the LGBT community’s “right to companionship” under Article 21 of the Constitution, in a passage worth quoting in its entirety: “There can be no doubt that an individual also has a right to a union under Article 21 of the Constitution. When we say union, we do not mean the union of marriage, though marriage is a union. As a concept, union also means companionship in every sense of the word, be it physical, mental, sexual or emotional. The LGBT community is seeking realisation of its basic right to companionship, so long as such a companionship is consensual, free from the vice of deceit, force, coercion and does not result in violation of the fundamental rights of others.” Finally, the Johar judgment has also highlighted the need for rape law reform to protect male survivors of sexual violence. The judgment has struck down Section 377 to the extent that it relates to sexual relations between consenting adults. The law needs to provide for cases where men are the victims of sexual assault. But should this be done under Section 377, with its Victorian understanding of sexual relations? After the 2013 rape law amendments, we now recognise that sexual assault is not limited to penile-vaginal intercourse. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 protects child sexual assault victims, regardless of their gender. However, there is no law to protect adult male victims of sexual assault, whether they are cis- or transgender. Parliament needs to fill these lacunae in the law. For all the latest  , download "
"September 7, 2018 5:48:14 am","A nation’s moment of reckoning","The arrest of human rights activists is a test for India’s people and its institutions","Dr Ashwani Kumar","The course of democracy anywhere in the world is defined by events that test its resilience and also add to it. The August 28 arrests of some of the country’s most respected human rights activists is one such watershed event which will test the will of the Indian people to assert their freedom and the capacity of libertarian institutions to resist the state’s onslaught on the republic’s core values. While the Supreme Court (SC) has interdicted the detention of the accused in jail, their house arrest is only a limited consolation. The truth is that the accused will have to face a never-ending oppressive prosecutorial process which, once initiated, consumes life and is destructive of one’s pride, dignity, and humanity. We cannot, therefore, let this moment pass without registering the force of the nation’s collective conscience to resist injustice against those who have chosen the path of service and commitment to social causes. Their life’s work and the well-documented surrounding circumstances of the arrests proclaim their credentials and a presumption of innocence qua the charges. While an attempt has been made by prosecuting authorities to link the arrests with the alleged “Maoist plot to assassinate the Prime Minister”, the case presented to the courts for transit warrants reportedly goes no further than alleging a case of incitement to violence through inflammatory speeches and historical references. The allegedly inflammatory exhortations are with reference to a plea to revolt against injustice in the backdrop of the Bhima-  violence during a Dalit March in January this year, which was preceded by a meeting of the Elgaar Parishad under the patronage of former Supreme Court Judge P B Sawant and a former judge of the Bombay High Court Justice Kolse Patil, both of whom see no legal justification for the arrests. The observation in the SC of Justice Chandrachud that “dissent is the safety valve of democracy” is a clear reiteration of the citizens’ right to differ and disagree. This is the philosophy that inspired our freedom movement and defines India’s constitutional democracy predicated on the people’s right to call state power to account, albeit within the constitutional framework. Unlawful detention with its accompanying injustices, including the innumerable instances of custodial torture, mock the promise of our dignitarian Constitution and rob citizens of their self-worth and dignity. The routine constitutional aberrations under the present dispensation are indeed an ominous portent. Charges of sedition against student activists in the past, the persecution of political opponents on trumped up charges, cases against office bearers of inconvenient NGOs and a brazen display of the state’s iron fist are reminiscent of the ways of dictatorial and colonial regimes. The arrests of Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navlakha, Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira — lawyer, journalist, poet and rights activists, respectively — would serve a national purpose if, rising above partisan considerations, we can galvanise ourselves as a nation and hold aloft the torch of freedom. A nation born to freedom is expected to vindicate the supreme sacrifices made by its freedom fighters so that we may enjoy the fruits of liberty, of which eternal vigilance is the price. We cannot ignore the defining lessons of history, which find an echo in the immortal words of Dante that “the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in a period of moral crisis preserve their neutrality” and in Ram Dhari Singh ‘Dinkar’’s celebrated verse “Samar shesh hai/ Nahin paap ka bhagi keval vyadh/ Jo tatasth hain/ Samay likhega unka bhi apradh” (The criminal alone is not responsible for the crime. Time will also record the crime of those who are neutral/indifferent to it). Historically, totalitarian movements and dictatorial regimes have their genesis in exaggerated threats to national security. Invariably, fundamental freedoms thus encroached upon in the name of security are seldom restored to their holders without an upsurge. Our own struggle for freedom was rooted in the conviction that a subject nation has a right to revolt, for which our founding fathers adopted peaceful means. How, then, can the Indian state, anchored in the promise of constitutional democracy and committed to the preservation of fundamental human freedoms, unjustly invoke oppressive laws against its own citizens crusading against social and political inequities? Considering the stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), under which the rights activists have been charged, it is hoped that the SC will insist upon the utmost circumspection on the part of the prosecuting agencies in pressing ahead with the prosecution. A nation that seeks continuing inspiration in its folklore of elevating nationalism associated with poets such as Ram Prasad Bismil, Allama Iqbal, Ashfaqullah Khan, Firaq Gorakhpuri, ‘Dinkar’ and Durga Sahai ‘Suroor’ cannot remain impervious to injustice, social or political. A verse by Allama Iqbal will remain relevant as long as our goal of establishing a just and humane social order remains an ongoing national enterprise: “Utho! Meri duniya ke ghareebo ko jaga do, kakh-e-umra ke dar-o-diwar hila do, jis khait se dehqan ko mayassar nahin rozi, uss khait ke har khosha-e-gandum ko jala do” (rise and wake up the poor of the world; shake the doors and walls of the mansions of the great; burn every stack of wheat from the field which does not yield a livelihood to farmers). We know that tyranny expands in proportion to the space available for its existence. By standing up against injustice we accept the burden of being and indeed, it is better to be than not to be.

"September 7, 2018 6:42:26 am","Voice of empathy and wisdom","The void left behind by Atal Bihari Vajpayee will not be filled","Shyamal Datta","As the flames from the pyre rose towards the fading light of the evening sky at Smriti Sthal on August 17, I offered my respectful homage to   (ABV), a humanist to the core, under whom I had the unique privilege of working, in different capacities, from 1996-2007. I was Director, Special Protection Group (SPG), in charge of the security of the Prime Minister of India, when the decks were cleared for a minority government led by ABV to assume office on May 16, 1996, after a fractured electoral verdict. The SPG sprang into action, taking command of 6, Raisina Road where the 13th Prime Minister designate of the country had lived for decades. A security architecture had to be put in place in the new location, taking into account the sensitivities of the prevalent eco system. The family, comprising daughter Namita, and son-in-law Ranjan Bhattacharya, were on board from the start, extending support for a security system at a place known for its unfettered access to people from different walks of life and across a diverse political spectrum. I had called on ABV and the family to explain the need of the hour. I was awe-struck, meeting the incumbent PM and colossus, who had straddled the Indian political domain for decades. The leader with a magnetic personality wore a milky white and crisply ironed khadi dhoti and kurta. What moved me was his amazing grace in putting me at ease. Following major modifications in the existing arrangements in the bungalow on Raisina Road, visible annoyance was seen against the “imposition” of security restrictions. The members of the Press Club across the road in particular had complained to ABV about the alleged harrassment and security-checking of visitors. As I entered, he greeted me with a warm namaskar. In a soft tone, he spoke about the sensitivities involved in relationships between the people and their representatives. Implicit in the pithy words was the import of what he expected us to do. That was his style and signature. He gave me a smile when I assured him that it would be a serious endeavour on the part of the SPG to “strike a balance” between relationships and requirements of security/protection. ABV had his unique way of testing waters. One morning, he desired to have his morning breakfast in his favourite restaurant in the locality nearby. He had cautioned against causing any inconvenience to daily customers and people in the locality and traffic. The SPG accepted the challenge, making a departure from the regular security drill by taking full advantage of the “surprise” element. The Prime Minister of India, perhaps for the first time in the history of the SPG, and to the disbelief of every one, had his breakfast in the mohalla restaurant. Some of the customers came to the table and congratulated the new PM on his assumption of the august office. The restaurant bearers who used to do errands for ABV until a few days ago, wore a nervous and surprised look on their face while serving the nation’s most famous customer. ABV looked amused and happy along with some of the family members. After assumption of office, the PM was to address a public rally at the Ramlila maidan in the evening. The family was kept informed that a bullet-proof rostrum would be used at the rally, in view of the sensitive security situation. On arrival, someone from the party pointed it out to ABV and he was upset. I was asked if it could be dismantled. I expressed my reservations but what compounded the situation was an unfortunate incident of one of the PSOs fainting on the dais, out of exhaustion. He was promptly whisked away and someone else took his place. But after the rally, some of those who were witness to the accident, were found finding fault with the SPG, pinpointing the danger in the fact that the PSO had carried a weapon. A bit of sensationalism in order to fish in troubled waters. What quietened them down was when it was pointed out to them that there is a drill that the “safety catch” of the small weapon had to be locked when the weapon is not in use. The rare incident was shared with those who mattered. The grace and understanding shown by them saw to it that no hue and cry was raised. It went a long way in sowing the seeds of trust which later blossomed into a banyan tree under the benign grace of the departed leader. As expected, the 13-day government came to an end with Atal Bihari Vajpayee tendering his resignation on May 28. Raisina Road became the location of a former Prime Minister and Race Course Road got a new occupant. It was in Raisina that one day I became a bit audacious, exceeding my charter of responsibility to ask ABV what had prompted him to go for the option of forming a government which was doomed to fail. I was prepared for a rebuff but after a pause, ABV observed “it was to ignite a beacon of hope for the future.” I returned from the SPG to the Intelligence Bureau in April 1997. After a brief interlude of about a year, ABV returned to power, heading the NDA in March, 1998 to form a government on a much firmer wicket. I got elevated to the post of Director, IB (DIB) in April 1998. I retired in May 2001 and became Governor, Nagaland in January 2002. My last visit to Vajpayeeji was on March 27, 2015. It was on the occasion of the conferment of the Bharat Ratna at his residence by President  . It was a unique honour for a retired Director, SPG, to be invited to such a momentous occasion. I was overwhelmed by the kind gesture. In the demise of Atal Bihari Vajpayee the nation has lost a humanist and a voice of empathy and wisdom. The nation and people will miss the statesman for a long time to come. For all the latest  , download "
"n/a","The Sudha Bharadwaj I know","Three young lawyers on the arrested Chhattisgarh-based lawyer and activist.","n/a","I must confess at the outset that before meeting Sudha Bharadwaj, I didn’t know much about her. This, perhaps, was for the best because it allowed me to form an opinion of her based on what I personally experienced and not what I had been told. One of the first things which struck me about her is her simplicity and clarity. She speaks from her heart and means what she says. There is no artifice. The Bilaspur home and office embody this spirit. There is no rigid hierarchy and people work as per their area of expertise, leading to a true sharing of knowledge. Sudha ji, I realised, has no false pride and wouldn’t think twice before asking her junior or even an intern about a doubt. She is open to inputs from anyone and encourages everyone to think independently. This open flow of ideas has created a harmonious and vibrant office. This open flow is also visible in her interactions with the villagers, workers who come to her seeking help. Unlike other offices, the people do not feel alienated but freely voice their concerns and are active participants in their legal journey. Law offices tend to become depressing and monotonous spaces, where drafting, filing and arguing take precedence over the person’s well being. However, that is not the case with Sudha ji or her offices. People talk freely about the rigours of litigation and the non-judgemental aura allows people to take breaks when needed and set the pace of their work. A novelty in today’s rat race. One of the other aspects about her is the respect she has earned from her peers. I remember once while in the high court, we met an advocate who, on learning I was with her office, remarked that I was fortunate to learn from one of the most ethical lawyers. He candidly admitted that most lawyers take up briefs purely for monetary reasons but not Sudha. She is guided by principles of justice or nyaya rather than money. Law is often referred to as a noble profession and it is because of people like Sudha Bharadwaj that it continues to be so. —  I started my law school journey in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, at a time when the human rights situation there was rapidly deteriorating. I wanted to use the lessons learnt in my classes to stand with the indigenous communities fighting for their rights. When I asked around for people I can work with, I was told by everybody to contact Sudha ji. It didn’t take me long to understand why. On my first meeting with Sudha ji, I asked her about the competing narratives regarding the condition of indigenous communities in Bastar. Her reply left a deep impact on me: “For a pedestrian on a narrow lane, the car driver is causing the trouble. For the car driver, the pedestrian is the nuisance. Your perspectives change based on where you are placed.” That was my first lesson in understanding my own caste and class privilege. Seeing Sudha ji go about her work, I learnt the importance of listening to your client rather than sermonising, especially when it involves people from marginalised sections. She has a strong commitment to respecting the agency of her clients and not appropriating their voices. Decisions are, therefore, always based on consensus and consent. Her commitment to her clients and dedication to the law hold important lessons for all lawyers. I often wonder how through all the troubles and disappointments, that smile never leaves her face. One could see it even in the pictures of her arrest. It is a reflection of her love for her work, her refusal to give up hope despite the odds. I feel privileged that I had the chance to get my first lessons in social justice practice from her. As we fight this renewed state oppression, her smile will be our guiding light. —  I got to know Sudha Bhardwaj during my internship with her and remained in touch after. She has been a constant source of support, inspiration and guidance. I remember being under a lot of pressure to take up a job in a progressive rights-based NGO after my graduation from TISS, but I also wanted to be in Goa (where my home is) and make a living. The only opening in Goa was with an NGO which implemented CSR work and I was selected and did not know what to do. I was very scared of being isolated by those with whom I shared my principles, as working in that organisation to me felt like I had made a compromise with my values — wanting to work for the people on the ground. But it was Sudha ji who comforted me and understood my situation. It meant a lot at that time. I learnt friendship and solidarity from her even though the choices we sometimes make don’t fit our framework of values. She never made me feel left out or guilty but understood the compulsions and practicality of life. —

"September 6, 2018 12:34:53 am","Will you tell me who I am?","The advisory against using ‘Dalit’ must be seen within a context: The policing of identities is part of the Hindu Rashtra project.","K. Satyanarayana","The advisory of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to satellite and TV channels to avoid using the term “Dalit” to refer to the Scheduled Castes has created an existential crisis. The other day when the Pune police raided my house and confiscated all my computers and digital storage devices, I spoke to the press representing myself as a Dalit scholar. How will I present myself to the media in my next press conference? I have published a volume titled Dalit Studies and compiled two major volumes on Dalit literature — No Alphabet in Sight and Steel Nibs Are Sprouting. How will the TV channels refer to my books? Will my Dalit Studies be called “Scheduled Caste Studies” when they report on my publications? I don’t know if I could still call myself a Dalit but certainly, the media should avoid calling me a Dalit in their reports. Some channels quickly accepted this “advisory” and used the term Scheduled Castes to refer to Dalits while discussing the Bhima   struggle. This banning of “Dalit” is not a simple issue of nomenclature. It is part of a larger agenda to create one nation and one identity. The ministry’s advisory dated August 7 cites the order of Bombay High Court (PIL no. 114/2016). It quotes: “As central Government has issued necessary directions to its officers, we find that it can also issue suitable directions as per law to the respondent No 2 and the media to refrain from using the same word. Various institutes in the field are not before us and hence, we direct respondent No 1 to consider the question of issuing such action to the media and take [a] suitable decision upon it within next six weeks.” The key phrases in the court order are “as per law” and “suitable decision”. The court has taken note of the communication sent by the Director, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment dated March 15, which advises “the Central Government, State Government and its functionaries to refrain from using the nomenclature ‘Dalit’ while referring to members belonging to Scheduled Caste.” It is clear that the director is issuing instructions to the officials of the central and state governments. The I&B Ministry deliberately plays mischief by saying “media may refrain from using the nomenclature ‘Dalit’ while referring to members belonging to Scheduled Caste in compliance with the directions of the Hon’ble Bombay High Court.” and ending with “for all official transaction, matters, dealings, certificates etc.” It can advise its officials but not the private media channels. This is the law that the court order refers to. The ministry has no legal power to ban the media from using the term Dalit, if you closely read the court order. How can you ban speech, categories or thought? Before we further examine this policing of the nomenclature of marginalised communities, a brief trajectory of the term “Dalit” will illuminate our discussion. Gopal Guru delineates the trajectory of the politics of the term in The Politics of Naming. Following Baburao Bagul’s analysis, Guru suggests that Dalit is a revolutionary category and it has the capacity to reach out to larger sections of people. It is not a mere linguistic construction but is based on materialist epistemology. Dalit refers to multiple, polycentric and dynamic relations of life. In other words, Dalit is an open-ended category of mobilisation and assertion of diverse communities subjected to untouchability. This term or name has not been accepted by all communities. It was noted that the middle-class Dalits have objected to the use of this term as it reminds them of their oppressive past. Some have objected to Dalit as it is similar to class or it has become exclusive to the identities of specific Scheduled Castes. The term Dalit is also pitted against terms like Buddhist or Bahujan. This internal creative debate on the term Dalit has always enriched its potential. The individual members of the Scheduled Castes have a right to not use the term Dalit. Precisely for this reason, the court has clearly desisted from banning the use of “Dalit” in society. The ministry also cleverly calls it an “advisory”. To understand the ministry’s mischief, we need to contextualise the policing of identities. The RSS and other Hindutva organisations have begun the campaign of identifying Indians and others. This process of naming and stigmatising the minorities as the “others” is an everyday experience. The RSS is quick to respond by advising its volunteers to avoid the term “Dalit”. It prefers “Scheduled Caste”. Scheduled Caste is a category of administration and statistics and it cannot encompass the diverse and rich life of Dalits. I have examined a special issue of the RSS mouthpiece Organiser on Ambedkar, “Revisiting Ambedkar”. RSS pracharaks did not use the term Dalit. Narendra Jadhav, who is not a trained RSS pracharak, calls Ambedkar “a Dalit leader”. RSS pracharaks use “untouchable.” If we find “Dalit” at one or two places, this may be because of the English translators’ usage. The RSS described three saint poets as “Untouchables” in the hoardings for the RSS-sponsored Rashtrodaya Samagam (Nation Awakening Meet) held on February 25 in Meerut. Dalit communities protested against this derogatory naming of the saints. It is my view that the legislating of terms, categories and thought is one of the central agendas of the RSS. The source for the I&B Ministry mischief is the intrusion of Hindutva forces in the institutions and state machinery of this country. Like the ministry, the police also share this ideological affinity. The Pune police and the Telangana special task force have asked me a number of questions in casual conversation. They asked me about my caste as any common Indian would. But then they asked my wife, Pavana, why she is not wearing marital symbols as she is a Brahmin. My inter-caste marriage, my caste status and my atheist culture have been brought up for discussion. I was told that reading Marx and Mao makes me a Maoist or Urban Naxal. Reading Marx and Ambedkar makes me part of the Bhima Koregaon conspiracy case. If I have no connection with the Maoists, why am I keeping these books? As Harish Khare observes, the Dalit is the new Muslim today. Or a Maoist. Because this is Hindu Rashtra. I have to have one identity, one   card, one caste certificate and one religion.

"September 6, 2018 12:29:15 am","Telescope: Finger on our lips","No matter what your views, you are in danger of being labelled ","Shailaja Bajpai","While watching television news, haven’t you often, very often, experienced an overwhelming and irresistible urge to smash the LED/TV screen to smithereens, silence the TV news anchors and strangulate all the “experts” whose views don’t agree with you or yours’? Don’t you nurse a secret ambition to overthrow the entire republic of news and views (ahem!) for increasingly fake, malicious and oh so deafeningly loud content — to establish, instead, some good old-fashioned, objective journalism? C’mon, be honest: Don’t you, sometimes, just want to line up the right wing, the left wing and those who occupy centre stage — and shoot the lot of them? And will that make you an “Urban Naxal”, a “Fascist” or a “#DeshDrohi” (Times Now) instead of the average, everyday person just venting their frustration in a bout of “Janta v/s Breaking News”? You can’t be too careful these days. No matter what shade of opinion you reflect, you will be labelled — and it won’t be as Raymond Suitings’ “Perfect Man”, either. Lessons from this week on TV? Don’t write letters (who writes them anyway?); in fact, don’t write, full stop. And never ever share your telephone number with anyone, else you may end up at a police press conference such as the one held, live, by the Maharashtra Police after the arrest of five “Urban Naxals”. Or you will become the speculation of much debate over your “sinister plot” to either “assassinate” the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh (India Today) or help Maoists overthrow the Indian state — as Congressman Digvijay Singh would have discovered, Tuesday afternoon, had he been watching television news, instead of plotting against the Indian state (News X, Times Now, Republic). And don’t be Gautam Navlakha, who is, apparently, the recipient of many incriminating “letters” from bad people. “Letters” to him arrive with curious regularity in the mailbox of Times Now, News X and Republic. Think someone in the PMO or on the news channels, which don’t receive these “letters”, should question such leaks. Could be a threat to the nation’s security, right? Best would be if you don’t speak at all — don’t air your views while flying 50,000 ft above sea level, either, to a politician, particularly. Otherwise, you could be arrested like Lois Sofia, who was very “irresponsible” in the words of BJP Tamil Nadu chief Tamilisai Soundararajan (India Today), to allegedly shout at her during a flight. Worse, we will all know your name and your face — both were splashed on TV news all of Tuesday — and your reputation will be in mud after the politicians have flung accusations and conspiracy theories at each other during TV debates, shooting from your shoulder (India Today, NDTV 24×7). Oh, and don’t use words like “shoot”. Obviously, you should never speak in public. You never know when excerpts of your remarks will resurface to arrest you. Speeches delivered by Navlakha, for instance, are playing on some news channels to prove his culpability; meanwhile, NDTV 24×7 played extracts from speeches at the Elgaar Parishad event (December 2017), before the Bhima-  celebratory rally was marred by violence — speeches that have been at the core of the case against the 10 people arrested for Maoist links. These, the channel said, offer a “rebuttal” to such charges. Basically, keep your lips sealed: Remember Kanhaiya Kumar & Co at a   University, Delhi, meeting? Words were put in their mouths, reportedly, and repeatedly broadcast on channels like Zee News to expose them as “anti-national”. Meanwhile, in a faraway more innocent world,   is asking questions, which you can answer without fear. Yes, his 10th season of Kaun Banega Crorepati ( ) has begun and it promises to be everything previous editions were — if anything the pace is even slower. The aim is to celebrate the contestants’ lives and enterprise more than their answers to the GK questions. And so the conversation between Sonia, a retired Air Force officer, and Big B in the first episode meandered through her life like a lazy river — not the ones in destructive spate in different parts of the country (India TV). Enjoy the soothing effect. By the way, in simpler times, Bachchan would end an episode of KBC with the greeting, Good night, shubh raatri, shabba khair — not necessarily in that order. He now concludes with, “Shubh ratri, shubh ratri, shubh ratri”. Maybe, greetings are also a punishable offence? Lastly, watching CB Strike (Star World Premiere) based on the detective novels by Robert Galbraith, better known as J K Rowling. Great fun following private detective Cormoran Strike and his assistant Robin Ellacott — nothing like a good murder mystery to help you forget the many dangers facing us in the real world.

"September 6, 2018 12:20:52 am","Repression As Distraction","Arrest of dissenters is a way for government to shift focus from the discontent","P B Sawant","The Emergency of 1975, howsoever repugnant, was at least declared under the provisions of the Constitution. The present Emergency, evidenced by various acts of lawlessness and repression by the government, does not make even that pretence. What is worse, it has been permitting any and every offence by the Hindutva forces, giving an impression they have the blessings of the state. On the other hand, the legitimate exercise of their fundamental rights by the opponents and critics of the present regime is sought to be punished and suppressed, to silence the lawful criticism and protests against the government. A kind of fascism is at work. The present and the past raids on the residences and the arrests of the activists — out of whom only two were associated with the Elgaar Conference held on December 31, 2017, in Pune — clearly evidences the arbitrary conduct of the government. The Elgaar Parishad was the second conference organised by this author along with others, the first being on October 4, 2015, at the same venue, to condemn and protest the unconstitutional conduct of the present regime and to demand the enforcement of the Constitution. This time, however, an organisation called the Kabir Kala Manch (KKM) joined us. There were many speakers at the conference and all of them emphasised the patent lawlessness and demanded that the government abide by the Constitution. At the end of the conference, all those gathered took a pledge that they will not rest till the present regime was changed. About five months after the conference, on June 6, the police raided the residences of the KKM activists under the pretext that they were Naxalites or Naxalite sympathisers. The present round of arrests has been made from various places in the country on August 28, also on the plea that those arrested were Naxalites and they wanted to “overthrow” the government. They are also alleging that the arrestees were associated with the organising of the conference and through the medium of the conference, they wanted to propagate Naxalite ideology. In fact, except for Sudhir Dhawle and Shoma Sen, no one else was either associated with or attended the conference, nor do we know them. This shows that the arrests are clearly politically motivated. It appears that panicked by the present wave of discontent against it, the government is trying to divert the attention of the people. Another reason for these arrests appears to be the recent unearthing of the plot of the Sanatan Sanstha (a Hindutva organisation) to manufacture bombs, explode them at different places and to create fear among the people. Being a patron of the Hindutva organisations, the government is also interested in diverting the attention of the people from the said plot of the Hindutvaites who are at present running amock and indulging in violent activities. This clearly amounts to encouraging communal forces. The police are at present busy making out a case that the arrestees were planning to overthrow the government by “violence”. They forget that we have a democratic Constitution, which permits people to overthrow a government through the ballot. But that will be decided by the court when the so-called evidence collected by the police is presented before it. For the present, it is not necessary to say anything more on the subject. The fact, however, remains that the present arbitrary and illegal actions let loose by the government have made the life of citizens insecure. Although the present regime does not appear to believe in democracy, it must abide by the Constitution. It cannot change the identity of the nation from the democratic to a fascist nation to suit its ideology, without changing the Constitution. For all the latest  , download "
"September 6, 2018 5:09:35 am","Why we need Dalit","The term seeks to change structures of oppression, rather than adjust to them","Suraj Yengde","A recent government advisory asked the media to avoid using the term “Dalit” in compliance with the orders of the Bombay and Madhya Pradesh High Courts. The courts directed the Centre and state governments to refrain from using the nomenclature as it “does not find any mention in the Constitution of India or any statute”. This advisory has led to a sudden distraction from the actual work that is required to bring about an improvement in the lives of Dalits. 
I have been involved in refining the categories of the caste dictionary and have argued repeatedly that the epithet of “lower” caste, below the “upper” caste, offers limited avenues of expression and rebellion, which are essential for systemic change. Anti-human and anti-equality discourses are outlandishly termed as “upper” without any qualifiers. Communities should have the agency to decide what they wish to call themselves. Thwarting their agency is the principal factor that goes into maintaining caste supremacy. The so-called “lower” beings are widely thought of by the occupants of agraharas as mindless, thoughtless and inactive components of Brahminical civilisation. “Dalit” means many things. It offers a historical grip and a route to the current realities. It keeps an account of the past, which is largely unwritten and unacknowledged. It is a phenomenological opportunity for a self-reliant existence, without being solely the subject of the oppressors’ interpretations. This is exactly what occurs to many educated Dalits, who prioritise the Brahminical interpretation of them without owning their own experiences as apriori. 
“Dalit” is primarily an anti-caste, anti-Brahminical, anti-capitalistic, anti-oppression, anti-superstition rebellion moulded into the totemic traditions of Dalit emancipation drawn from the experiences of their ancestors’ quest to life. Dalit is a militant affirmation and not a malleable subservient jauhar that many oppressor castes would want to appropriate. The evolution of the word Dalit or Pad-Dalit was strongly emphasised by B R Ambedkar in his Marathi writings during his years of active journalism and public speaking from 1920 onwards. He fashioned the term for the Depressed Classes to unionise the political categories that are subsumed under it. The translation of Dalit — broken people — was studied anthropologically by Ambedkar in The Untouchables: Who Were They and Why They Became Untouchables? Ambedkar argued that the broken men were a defeated tribe of the constant tribal warfare in primitive society. Despite these antecedents, there continues to be a controversy within the Dalit community over the usage of the term. Some Dalits prefer staying with the constitutionally-decided terminology (Scheduled Caste), some prefer a neo-Buddhist identity, and some are happy to identify with their sub-caste or sub sub-caste identification. The middle-class Dalits, who now unexpectedly populate spaces of power, have to deal with the stigmatised identities heaped upon them over millennia — of being inferior beings. They feel it inappropriate to be “lower” when they have reached great heights in their careers. Many refrained from using the word Dalit long before the high courts thought of its unacceptability. Dalits, who are constantly seeking to escape their identity but cannot due to their known caste status, want to find ways to move away from this “lowerness”. Thus, they concentrate on identities such as Ambedkarite, Ravidassi or Valmiki to identify with an exceptional individual in the face of Brahminical oppression. On the other hand, there are many Dalit groups who prefer going with their sub/sub-sub caste categorisation as a way to emphasise their sense of history and being. The Dalit literary world has expressed “Dalit” in conjunction with the metaphors that usher in a new life. The idea of “humanism, freedom, rebellion, and equality” is strongly reinforced in the popularisation of the term. Literary stalwart Gangadhar Pantawane defended the use of “Dalit” as a phenomenon of “radical consciousness” which goes beyond caste and affirms a “symbol of revolution”. The Dalit Panthers envisaged a collective struggle by tying together the “members of Scheduled Castes and tribes, Neo-Buddhists, the working people, the landless and poor peasants, women and all those who are being exploited politically, economically and in the name of religion”. What “Dalit” offers is a tool to express oneself without reliance on the oppressor’s vocabulary. The way a word plays out and its inter-relationality to political praxis is determined in the ways in which it diffracts. “Dalit” is an open category. It is not confined to the experiences of a particular caste or sub-caste group. It is a call to all those who believe in the project of annihilation of caste to align with the Dalit struggle without alluding to any ordained isms. It is liberating and encourages rebellion. We should add positive affirmations to the Dalit being. We should propagate categories such as Dalit beauty, Dalit courage, Dalit rebellion, Dalit resilience, Dalit love, Dalit fight, Dalit creativity, Dalit power. The word Dalit should be so synonymous with multi-metaphors of acceptability that many non-Dalit volunteers buy into the struggle of Dalits. 
While on the subject, why don’t we also reconsider the use of words like Brahmin and introduce a more workable category beyond the “forward caste” utterance? Instead of delegitimising the nature of Dalit consciousness, the government and civil society at large should discourage the constant impounding of derogatory words like “upper and lower castes”. The “upper” caste is a blanketed category that cleverly undermines the experiences of poor and oppressed “upper” caste people. The experiences of Brahmins are significantly different from Baniya or Khatris or other thread-bearing castes. “Dalit”, on the other hand, unifies rather than homogenises the experiences of all those forced into one category. Let’s make it simple for everyone and stay with what Ambedkar envisaged, while rampantly deploying the terminology to burn down the desires of oppressors. The government should indeed proceed with a workable nomenclature such as Scheduled Caste. However, in operation, its babus most often continue to relegate their Scheduled Caste citizens with sub-caste categorisation. Scheduled Caste is a bureaucratic normalisation. It has no capacity to change the structures of oppression. Instead, it seeks to adjust the lived reality and everyday experiences into the lopsided statistics of policies. “Dalit”, on the other hand, evokes, emotions of change and positivity. Emotions that I would love to experience for the time being. For all the latest  , download "
"September 6, 2018 12:15:16 am","The remixwallahs","Even if they aren’t the greatest pieces of music, remixes are a tribute to the original artistes","Editorial","A much-remembered theka (rhythmic phrase) on the tabla had opened “chalte chalte, yun hi koi mil gaya tha”, the iconic composition by composer Ghulam Mohammad in Lata Mangeshkar’s voice in Kamal Amrohi’s Pakeezah (1972). The piece transported the audience into the world of a courtesan named Sahibjaan. Now, almost 45 years later, composer Tanishk Bagchi has used parts of the song in his version of it in an upcoming film Mitron. Rendered by Pakistani singer Atif Aslam, it uses a similar tune and catchlines but has rewritten words. On Tuesday, Mangeshkar lashed out at Bagchi and Aslam, asking “where was the creativity in simply lifting acknowledged, beloved classics and shuffling the notes around.” Her anguish is understandable. But does a remix really mean the death of creativity? It’s not just about beefing up the beat and making it dance floor ready. If done well, a remix can become a creative project. The attempt, also, is an ode to the original work. The introduction of remixed versions in films today is an attempt by filmmakers to draw attention, pull audiences into theatres. Remixes came to India in the ’90s when classics such as “kaliyon ka chaman” (Jyoti, 1983) and “sayiyaan dil mein aana re” (Bahar, 1951) had the younger audience shake a leg to them. The videos were criticised for liberties taken with original themes, but youngsters, whose grandparents and parents would have hummed these pieces, were crooning and dancing to the new versions. Sometimes it requires another pair of ears to renew the song. Many international remixes have become popular after being recreated, sometimes overshadowing the original. It may not happen all the time, and there are many disastrous remixes, but the notion that touching an original piece of music is blasphemous, seems outdated. For all the latest  , download "
"September 6, 2018 12:15:14 am","River and stick","Draft bill that recommends punitive measures to clean Ganga is a climbdown from the Namami Gange project","Editorial","In May, Union Water Resources Minister   announced that the government will “try to ensure” a 70-80 per cent improvement in the Ganga’s water quality by March 2019. The water resources ministry, it seems, is now taking desperate, rather than sensible, measures to meet that deadline. If it has its way, a host of activities that impact the Ganga will be deemed illegal. These include construction activities that obstruct the river, withdrawal of groundwater for commercial or industrial purposes, commercial fishing and discharging of sewage into the the river. The ministry has drafted a bill which prescribes a slew of penal provisions — including fines and imprisonment — to curb these activities. The draft also envisages a Ganga Protection Corps “to arrest those who pollute the river”. Such reliance on punitive measures is a disturbing climbdown from the government’s Namami Gange project in more ways than one. Namami Gange recognises that the key to reviving the river lies in a robust sewage infrastructure. The programme that took off two years ago ticked several boxes about the river’s ecology. It had projects to develop interceptor drains, plant trees and improve the river’s species composition. More importantly, the project accepted that its success hinged on the support of the people, whose activities impact the Ganga. In May, the Water Resources Minister talked of the government’s resolve to attain synergy between ecology and development. He also talked of plans to link the livelihood needs of local communities with efforts to clean the Ganga. This dovetailed with the Ministry’s project to create a cadre of village and town-level volunteers who would help panchayat, municipal and other local bodies to monitor the quality of the Ganga’s water. There has been very little, however, by way of giving effect to these plans to ensure people’s participation. The Namami Gange website talks of awareness campaigns to curb pollution of the river. But it has nothing on the successes or failures of these projects. Namami Gange, in fact, has been dogged by the failing of other Ganga clean-up projects — the gap between intention and implementation. Till March, the water resources ministry had spent barely a fifth of the Rs 20,000 crore allocated for the project. In July, the National Green Tribunal pulled up the government for “tardy progress” on the Clean Ganga Mission. Even then, the government would do well to remember that it does have a lot of the basics in place. There is no reason for a law heavy on punitive measures to clean the Ganga.

"September 6, 2018 12:10:10 am","The next CJI","Chief Justice of India names successor, signals that transition in apex court will not be derailed by turmoil in and around it","Editorial","The Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra, due to retire in October, has named the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court after him as his successor. In normal circumstances, that statement, the event it describes, would be unremarkable. After all, the established convention and procedure is that the sitting CJI recommends the most senior SC judge fit to hold office, and the recommendation is processed and forwarded to the President who issues a warrant of appointment. That convention has held, barring two exceptions, both during the prime ministership of  , when two CJIs were elevated out of turn bypassing the senior-most judges, who then resigned. But these are not normal circumstances. Ever since the crisis of the judiciary — the tensions within it and between the judiciary and the executive — were publicly outed in January this year, and because Justice Ranjan Gogoi was one of the four senior judges who went public with a press conference, speculation has gained ground that he could be overlooked when the time came. The turbulence triggered by that January press conference in and around a traditionally sedate institution has still not abated. Against that backdrop, and in the context of the turbulence, therefore, CJI Misra’s decision to abide by the established convention stands out — and it reassures. Justice Gogoi’s elevation is still to be finalised, but the signal from CJI Misra, the first CJI to have an impeachment motion moved against him, is that the passing of the baton in the highest court of the land will not be affected by the turmoil of the day. The transition in the judiciary will adhere to institutional norms, the written and, more importantly, those that may be unwritten but have acquired power from custom and convention that is so vital in shoring up the distribution of power, and the checks and balances, in a constitutional system. Going ahead, however, the new CJI will have his hands full. He must grapple not just with important cases, but also with bristling institutional irresolutions. He must address the important questions thrown up this year, beginning with those that have to do with the CJI’s own role in the allocation of cases as “master of the roster”. Then, he must find a way of assuaging the fears stoked by an executive armed with a decisive mandate that the independence of the judiciary, the balance of powers between the executive and the judiciary, is being disturbed, especially through executive pressure and interference in the process of higher judicial appointments. These are difficult times for the court. In times such as these, the court must play its traditional role, of course, of speaking Constitution to power, upholding it in letter and spirit. But along with constancy, the court is also called upon to show innovation and flexibility in dealing with new challenges.

"September 5, 2018 12:59:45 am","Re-imagining the university","This Teachers’ Day, let us recall a 1949 report written under the leadership of S Radhakrishnan","Janaki Nair","The time has come, more urgently than ever, to speak of that gravely endangered space of the Indian public university system. It is poised like an elephant hanging over a cliff with only its tail tied to a daisy. Neither is the mind striding around without fear, nor is the head being held high. Instead, teachers are being attacked for voicing opinions, as in the vicious assault on Sanjay Kumar, assistant professor of sociology at the MG Central University of Bihar. Other teachers are being raided, and their life’s work “seized” merely because of the accident of marriage to the daughter of a renowned, though radical, poet, as was K Satyanarayana of the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. Yet others are being placed under overzealous police scrutiny (if not being actually arrested) for their critical writings, or association with legitimate rights and civil society groups, as were Nandini Sundar and Archana Prasad, and now a wide range of teacher-intellectuals such as Sudha Bharadwaj or Shoma Sen. All this follows the actual murder of teachers such as HS Sabharwal in 2006 and MM Kalburgi in 2015. There are, too, those teachers who are being collectively bludgeoned by their own administrations intent on driving the scholarship of teaching and learning into the ground, as has been happening in JNU for the last two-and-a-half years. Delhi University had faced the wrecker’s ball slightly earlier. The intolerance of research, fearless speech, and contrary opinions has reached a crescendo in the past four years — the murderous intent to exterminate all intellectuals was announced by a BJP MLA from Karnataka, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal. And the Higher Education Commission of India proposes to do away altogether with teacher participation in the very institutions by which they will be governed. Let us, therefore, declare this Teachers’ Day a day of silent reflection, introspection and remembering, of all that the public university may have achieved, its obvious failures, and its portentous future. How far we have travelled from the deeply prescient report, written in 1949 with admirable literary flourish, under the leadership of the man whose name is commemorated today,  . Written in the first flush of Independence, when world-class institutions such as the IITs and IIMs were not even a twinkling in the nation’s eye, the document was a hard-nosed look at the existing university system, its promises, its failures and its possibilities. Our finest tribute to Radhakrishnan would be to remind ourselves of the breadth of that vision. In it, universities were described as the “sanctuaries of the inner life of the nation”, as the “organs of civilisation” where “Everything is being brought to the test of reason — venerable theologies, ancient political institutions, time-honoured social arrangements, a thousand things that a generation ago looked as fixed as the hills”. The commission was conscious of the precipitous preoccupations of a new nation: “We must give up,” said the report, “the fatal obsession with the perfection of the past, that greatness is not to be attained in the present, that everything is already worked out and that all that remains for the future ages of the world is pedantic imitation of the past.” Indeed, “Universities are the homes of intellectual adventure.” Recognising, with an appropriate quote from T S Eliot, that information had imperiled knowledge, as much as knowledge had forestalled wisdom, the report reminded us that “we are building a civilisation, not a factory or a workshop”. “Our ancient teachers, tried to teach subjects and impart wisdom. Their ideal was wisdom (irfan) along with knowledge (urn)”. “ ” was not far behind, but with the choice of those two opening words, the report acknowledged a different composite intellectual heritage from the impoverished intellectual past that is being promoted today. Just two elements of this fascinating document deserve our attention. At a time when there is mindless pursuit of glory via science and technology (to which five of the six Institutes of Eminence, which have been chosen to blazon our way into international rankings, are devoted), let us hear what this document said: “If we wish to bring about a savage upheaval in our society, a raksasa raj, all that we need to do is to give vocational and technical education and starve the spirit. We will have a number of scientists without conscience, technicians without taste who find a void within themselves, a moral vacuum and a desperate need to substitute something, anything, for their lost endeavour and purpose.” The haste with which JNU has opened a school of engineering, across the road from an equally illustrious institution which has been unable to fill its seats this year, appears to be a fulfillment of this ominous prophesy. Two, listen to the report on university autonomy: “Higher education is, undoubtedly, an obligation of the State but State aid is not to be confused with State control over academic policies and practices.” Further: “Professional integrity requires that teachers should be as free to speak on controversial issues as any other citizens of a free country.” An atmosphere of freedom is essential for developing this “morality of the mind”. Yet the autonomy that has, ironically, been recently thrust on institutions like JNU has come to mean the freedom to raise fees, bring in faculty at enhanced salaries or start innumerable certificate courses, which convert an admirably autonomous research university into a teaching shop. The Indian public university, despite the innumerable problems it faces, in no small part due to the compromises made by teachers themselves, has many creditable achievements that were not foreseen even by the Radhakrishnan Report. But it is to its lofty imagination that we must cling when the bonfires are being lit and the macabre dance of anti-intellectualism has begun. For all the latest  , download "
"September 5, 2018 12:58:09 am","Teacher vs System","A growing mistrust of educators is undermining the profession.","Ameeta Mulla Wattal","The country is celebrating Teachers’ Day in the memory of  , former President of India and an iconic educationist. Radhakrishnan was a legendary figure in the world of education and valued the contribution of teachers in nation-building and shaping the lives of children. Every civilisation and culture has celebrated its teachers for their role in the academic, social and emotional development of children, inculcating in them values and character that makes them compassionate holistic human beings. The home and community are a melting pot of emotions, desires, attitudes and aspirations. One may think that the energies that reside in these places are positive but there’s a great deal that lies at a sub-conscious level within the collective humanity that inhabits these places. Thoughts of religious intolerance, stress disorder, child neglect, caste, community, environmental insensitivity, personal competition and a plethora of issues envelop this space. The “guru shishya parampara” today stands at a crossroads from a relationship that was nurturing healthy and empowering to becoming one of mistrust. We are perhaps the only country where any untoward incident within or outside the school holds the principal and teacher immediately accountable. On the one hand, the government speaks of restoring the professional dignity of teachers and heads of schools and on the other, there seems to be a societal and systemic aggression directed against them, resulting in disrespect. This is disturbing because it is creating a culture of suspicion between the teaching community and the system, and more crucially between teachers and students. Vulnerable as they have become, and regardless of whether they belong to a government or a private institution, it has now become a battle of survival for teachers. There seems to be a growing tendency to immediately pin all responsibility for any untoward incident at the school without a systematic investigation that involves evidence, witnesses, documentation, et al. In the case of an abhorrent molestation or unfortunate accident, it is the duty of the school to help identify the perpetrator or the person responsible along with informing the parents and reporting the matter to the police. A school fails if it does not ensure adequate checks such as electronic surveillance, security, systems and processes or attempts to suppress the incident and is unwilling for an internal investigation. All this can be considered a dereliction of duty. Sometimes a teacher and administrator are blamed for incidents which are out of their control — if a cricket ball hits a child in a game or a school bus meets with an accident; a child falls and is critically injured or succumbs to an asthmatic attack. Even if there is an unfortunate suicide of a student at home. With the growing demands of modern life, parents feel increasingly pressured to reduce the time and attention they give to their child. Consequently, their expectations of the school are increasing, and the relationship between the two is becoming progressively transactional. Meanwhile, schools are battling crises daily, with police interventions and complaints to local authorities abounding and issues being blown out of proportion by the electronic and social media. More energy and time are taken up in crisis management than in creative, child-centric work. This situation is undoubtedly unhealthy, and the fear is that if it is allowed to persist, it might impel the teaching community towards complete indifference and push it towards constant vigilance rather than its core responsibility, teaching. The mind is a garden that contains seeds of understanding, forgiveness and love along with seeds of ignorance, fear and hatred. It is only an enriched nurturing environment that will help to water the positive seeds. Preparing children academically, inculcating values and moulding them into competent and compassionate human beings is expected from a teacher. The role of the teacher remains unchanged but they have to do all this without authority, with a trust deficit and lack of belief in the tenets of their profession. They are expected to assess students with objectivity and yet accused of harassment by deliberately failing them. The government itself in its new policy has created a system that fails students, by amending the no-detention policy. How are schools supposed to move forward on this stand on failure, where a principal or a teacher becomes the immediate victims of the system? India needs 1.3 million teachers at the elementary level. The shortfall is more glaring at the secondary and senior levels. There is also the threat of the new generation ignoring teaching as a profession because of more lucrative and seemingly attractive alternatives. The teaching community has kept quiet so far. We need our voices to be heard. The government must react positively and judiciously by drafting legislation to protect the rights of teachers who are facing attacks not only on their integrity but also on their person. Wrongdoing cannot be tolerated, but the treatment must be fair and just. Does all this mean that we are ready for the demise of the brick-and-mortar school and the formal instructor-led learning system? That would script the obituary of the teacher and the profession.

"September 5, 2018 12:46:06 am","Make India Vishwaguru again","To reclaim our place as the leader in the realm of education and ideas, we must stop blindly aping the West. We must deepen our understanding of our intellectual heritage.","M Venkaiah Naidu","Ever since I became the vice-president, I have been visiting various universities to attend their convocations. I keep reflecting on the glorious Indian heritage, the heights to which education had reached in the past and the ways in which we can re-infuse that spirit of excellence in our education system. We have a rich tradition of debate and dialogue in the pursuit of knowledge. The Upanishads are an eloquent testimony to the constant, constructive dialogue between the teacher and the taught. Thanks to innumerable thinkers, researchers and teachers who absorbed the best in the world and charted out a path on their own, India emerged as a global centre of learning and was described as “Vishwaguru”. The world looked up to India. “We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made,” said Albert Einstein. Mark Twain described India as “the cradle of human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great-grandmother of tradition. Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only.” Ancient India was home to some of the famous centres of learning like Takshashila, Nalanda and Pushpagiri, which attracted knowledge seekers and savants from across the country and the world. The Vedas and subjects such as agriculture, philosophy, mathematics, archery, military arts, surgery, medicine, astronomy, futurology, magic, commerce, agriculture, music and dance were taught at these centres of higher learning. In the 7th century AD, Xuanzang, a Chinese scholar, studied with many famous Buddhist masters at the famous university at Nalanda. When he returned, he carried with him some 657 Sanskrit texts. With the emperor’s support, he set up a large translation bureau in Xi’an with collaborators from all over East Asia. Chanakya, the author of Arthashastra and Charaka, famous Ayurvedic physician, were products of Takshashila. The excavations of urban settlements and buildings at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have proved that India was ahead of others in the world at that time. India’s priceless contribution of the zero and decimal system and its advancements in the fields of metallurgy speak of its greatness as an early world civilisation. Kanad spoke of “anu” and its indestructible nature long before John Dalton propounded the atomic theory. Sushrutha is known as the father of plastic surgery. India could achieve this excellence because it valued learning. It is also a country that welcomed good ideas from everywhere and said in the Rig Veda: Aano bhadraah krathavo yantu vishwathaha (Let noble thoughts come to us from all sides). This assimilation, acceptance and adaptation, leading to ideation, lay at the heart of India’s progress in the realm of ideas. We need to foster a new mindset — not the blind acceptance of any concept wherever it has emanated from but adopt an analytical stance. Some would describe this as moving away from the colonial mindset in which we unquestioningly adopt and borrow from others. Many like Koneru Ramakrishna Rao feel that the westernisation of India’s education system has robbed Indians of original thinking and made them develop a mindset of looking with awe at anything Western, while undervaluing one’s own culture and native ethos. The way to overcome this syndrome is to deepen our understanding of our intellectual lineage and draw lessons for the revitalisation of the education system. Education is a life-long process. However, it is important to ensure that children are taught in their mother tongue for better learning outcomes. Imparting value-based education rooted in our socio-cultural milieu is the need of the hour. What we need today is a critical mass of people who are imbued with this spirit of inquiry, a mindset that doesn’t rely on blind belief but searches for answers and evidence through relentless research as well has an openness to new ideas. Our ancient thinkers saw the acquisition of knowledge as a liberating experience. It liberates us from ignorance, superstition, irrational prejudices and unfounded fears. “Saa vidyaa yaa vimuchyathe,” they said. Rabindranath Tagore had called for a renaissance where the “mind is without fear and the head is held high”. That’s the heaven of freedom we all should aspire for. The colonial shackles must be broken. As Kalidasa, the great Sanskrit poet says, “All that is ancient is not necessarily good. Nor should you think that whatever is modern is bad. Wise persons carefully analyse and come to a conclusion whereas the foolish persons are blindly led by other’s views.” There are numerous statements in our ancient texts that can inspire all of us to rise to greater heights. We need to study these texts and internalise their key messages. For instance, at the end of the course of study, the teacher gives the following message to the students. This message taken from Taittariya Upanishad reads like a convocation address that is more relevant today than ever before: “Be truthful. Do your duties. Continue to study and learn. Do not swerve from the path of Truth and Dharma, and contribute something useful to the society. Aim for excellence. Keep improving your knowledge. Use whatever you have learnt and share your knowledge with others. Respect the gods and your ancestors. Look upon your parents, teachers and guests as gods. Always analyse and distinguish the good from the bad. Avoid the latter and always do what is good. Follow all that was good in your teacher’s life, not any other. You will meet with better men than even the teachers with whom you have lived. Show them due respect. ” This advice has many important elements that are critical for making the big leap we wish to make towards new high watermarks in educational leadership. The themes of lifelong learning, quality consciousness, social relevance of knowledge, ethics, empathy, reverence, humility and commitment find a sharp, succinct expression. The post-Independence Indian education system has produced outstanding scholars, scientists and achievers in different fields with institutions like Indian Institute of Science, IITs and IIMs emerging as centres of excellence. Access to education has expanded but what we need to do is to transform our institutions into “learning” institutions that constantly reinvent themselves and position themselves to be the leaders in knowledge production and knowledge dissemination. While absorbing the best educational practices and concepts from around the globe, we need to have an educational system that is best rooted in our culture, traditions and heritage. Swami Vivekananda had said, “Learn everything that is good from others, but bring it in, and in your own way absorb it; do not become others”. We can be Vishwaguru once again only if we can make the quest for excellence the norm. We can elevate our institutions of learning into world-class institutions if we foster a culture of research and innovation, of instructional leadership and ethical behaviour. I do hope on this Teachers’ Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of  , the first Vice President of India, we shall accord the respect due to our indefatigable teachers and facilitate their endeavour to transform the classrooms in which our country’s future is being shaped.

"September 5, 2018 12:20:46 am","Where interests meet","Trump’s recalibration of US’s international relations and India’s ambition to play a larger global role fit together","C. Raja Mohan","The idea that India-US relations are enveloped by a crisis has been a recurring theme for the last quarter of a century and more. Yet, since the end of the Cold War, the bilateral relationship has made a steady advance across a broad front. Despite the presumption or hope in many sections at home and abroad that something will surely trip up India and the US, their partnership has become stronger by the day. The lack of pace and the enduring sense of unrealised potential do, however, continue to dampen the enthusiasts in both capitals. For India, ties with the US have emerged as the most comprehensive among all its major power relationships. In terms of breadth, it ranges from defence and high technology cooperation to a substantive people-to-people relationship. In terms of weight, it is the most important economic relationship — annual two-way trade in goods and services now stands at nearly $140 billion and mutual investments are on the way up. Even more significant is the growing convergence of perspectives on regional and international affairs. Few other powers have been as positive as the US in addressing either India’s concerns about terrorism in the region or as supportive of its aspirations for a larger international role. Further, India has no territorial disputes with the US. Nor have Delhi’s armies ever had to confront Washington’s. It is quite easy to forget this amid the media focus on the minutiae of the bilateral relations. The first ever “two-plus-two” meeting between Delhi and Washington — that brings together the foreign and defence ministers of India and the United States around one table — is at once the symbol of the progress made so far as well as the platform to address new issues in the relationship. The forum could also help set more ambitious goals for the future. But first, to the latest bout of gloom and doom. Much of it flows from the claim that US President Donald Trump’s policies are derailing the relationship. Some of these arguments are about the breakdown of bipartisanship in Washington and the open confrontation between Trump and the traditional foreign policy establishment. The ground reality, however, is quite different. Although many of America’s traditional partners have found themselves at the receiving end of Trump’s effort to reorient US foreign policy, the consequences for India have not been too severe to cope with. On the two primary areas of concern for India — Pakistan and China — Delhi, in fact, has no reason to complain about Trump’s policies. On the sources of terror in Pakistan and its destabilisation of Afghanistan, Trump has mounted the kind of pressure on Rawalpindi that his predecessors were not willing to consider. Trump’s pushback against China’s assertive policies has already opened up new diplomatic space for Delhi in the Indo-Pacific, including with Beijing. To be sure, the continuing escalation of tensions between Washington and Moscow has begun to pose new problems for the bilateral relationship. Since the end of the Cold War, India did not have to look over its shoulder in its engagement with either Russia or America. Delhi will now have to deal with this new situation. The new US law that mandates sanctions against countries that buy arms from Russia is at the centre of the current debate. For all the concern about India’s plans to buy the S-400 missiles from Russia and the consequences in the US, both Delhi and Washington have incentives to manage their differences. Washington has no reason to wreck the growing military relationship with India — which has seen the US expand its share in arms sales to India at the expense of Russia — by making the S-400 as some kind of red line that can’t be crossed. India, on its part, needs to take full advantage of the strategic possibilities with the US for modernising India’s military as well as its defence industrial base. If Trump can find a way to provide a waiver for India, Prime Minister   has the means to make it worthwhile for Trump. How the issue might get finessed is a matter of diplomatic detail, if there is political will on both sides to find a way. The Iran problem might be a lot easier to manage. It’s been done before amidst the continuing confrontation between Tehran and Washington. More than a decade ago, the UPA government refused to sacrifice India’s rising stakes in the US relationship for the sake of Iran. There is no reason why the NDA would do this now. Meanwhile, India’s interests are rapidly rising in the UAE and Saudi Arabia — two countries that are in a deepening conflict with Iran. Far more significant is the problem on the trade front. Driven by powerful domestic political considerations, Trump has chosen to confront all of America’s major economic partners — from Canada to China and Mexico to Japan — on ending the trade imbalance. India is certainly on the list of countries with a trade surplus with the US. Like all other partners of Washington, Delhi, too, must find ways to limit the damage to its most important trade relationship through practical negotiations. India and the United States have advanced their partnership over the last few years by sticking to two important principles. One is the political commitment not to let any one problem derail the broader partnership and the other is to continue to expand the areas of engagement that yield additional gains for both. As they iron out the current wrinkles in the bilateral relationship, the four ministers have an opportunity to take a fresh look at the partnership. While small steps are possible and will be announced, the two sides must try and break from the frustrating tradition of incrementalism. What creates the room for some bold thinking about the next steps in the bilateral relationship is the fit between Trump’s effort to recalibrate America’s international relations and India’s ambitions to play a larger global role. Trump wants to cut America’s offshore burdens and get allies and partners to do more. As a rising power, Delhi is eager to take more responsibility for promoting regional peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. Translating this alignment of interests into concrete outcomes requires the development of a new framework for burden-sharing and strategic coordination. For all the latest  , download "

"September 5, 2018 4:33:09 am","Dissent Is Democracy","Arrest of activists casts a shadow over state’s commitment to constitutional values","L Ramdas","I am a former fauji who retired as Chief of the Naval Staff on September 30 1993. I joined the Joint Services Wing, Clement Town, Dehra Dun, as a callow youth of 15 years and four months in January 1949 and after 44 years and some months in white uniform, fell out the other end as the head of a wonderful service at the age of 60. I was thus uniquely privileged to be part of and to “bear witness” to the growth and progress made by independent India. One of the main events that comes to mind is the transition we made from that of being a dominion in the British Commonwealth to an independent, sovereign, democratic Republic, whilst we were still cadets at the Joint Services Wing. It was after nearly two years of intensive debate amongst the members of the Constituent Assembly of India that India adopted her Constitution on November 29, 1949 and this came into effect on January 26, 1950, the day we celebrate as  . The Constitution assured every Indian citizen, irrespective of religion, caste or community, all the fundamental freedoms and rights, as indeed duties and responsibilities. It was one of the most progressive and remarkable documents produced under the stewardship of Babasaheb Ambedkar and his team of eminent, critical and intellectually mature men and women, who were able to translate the hopes and dreams of millions into a vision document spelling out the framework for a democratic, just and inclusive India. For those of us who had joined the armed forces of a newly independent nation, it was an exhilarating moment. And when we were commissioned as officers in 1952 and 1953, it is to that Constitution that we swore our allegiance. Indeed every civil servant, politician and those holding public office does likewise, starting with the highest in the land, the President of India, who is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Seven decades down the line — while much has been done and achieved of which our nation can justifiably be proud — there are serious concerns about the core values we had also set out for ourselves. I refer here to the freedom of thought, expression, and religion, and the fundamental premise on which a healthy democracy is based — namely, the right to equality regardless of caste, faith and gender, and the responsibility to voice dissent and uphold our secular and inclusive polity in such a manner that the last woman or man is never excluded or exploited. The steady erosion of these basic pillars of our democracy — as embodied in the executive, legislature and judiciary — has led to the present visible decline in following the basic norms, which have always guided our institutions. This has been exemplified in recent times by several anti- and un-democratic actions by the state, and increasingly, by non-state actors, as seen in the mob lynchings and other such manifestations of the breakdown of law and order. 
The latest glaring display of this has been in the totally unwarranted and illegal manner in which five well-known human rights activists have been pursued and arrested by the Pune police from several locations across the country in total violation of their fundamental rights and the law of the land for crimes, which appear to be totally unspecified and unsubstantiated. As a citizen and a service veteran, I feel it is my sacred duty to express my deep distress and concern, especially when too many of us, in keeping with one of the traditions with which we in uniform were trained, are silent. Our silence is not to be mistaken for consent. Large numbers of veterans are deeply unhappy with the turn of events in our republic. There are some of us who have written open letters to the highest in the land, sharing our concerns. I am happy that in its wisdom, the Supreme Court has put a stay on these arrests. I can only echo the words of the judge who has firmly upheld one of the pillars of any democratic system when he says, “Dissent is the safety valve of democracy”. For all the latest  , download "
"September 5, 2018 12:15:11 am","Much in a name","Government orders use of Scheduled Caste, not Dalit. The move lacks sensitivity to history and context","Editorial","The directive of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to the media to “refrain from using the nomenclature Dalit” and to stay with “Scheduled Caste” is problematic. The ministry has chosen to blindly follow a Bombay High Court order that asked the Union government to “consider” issuing a directive to the media on the matter. In March, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment had issued orders to all state governments that only the term Scheduled Caste should be used in official communication. Scheduled Caste, of course, is the term used in the Constitution. And the judiciary and government can decide on the preferred term in administrative matters. It could even be argued that “Dalit” is a more encompassing, less precise term. Yet, the directives of the ministry and the court reveal an insensitivity towards the history and context that led to the adoption of the Marathi word to describe the erstwhile “untouchable” castes. Dalit is a political identity that emerged in the 1970s in connection with the rise of Dalit literature in Marathi and the Dalit Panthers, a militant movement based out of Maharashtra’s urban centres. It drew inspiration from Babasaheb Ambedkar and sought to build on his political legacy. It rejected the patronage of mainstream political parties and preferred the idiom of self-assertion. Though the Dalit Panthers did not survive as a political outfit for long, the term found widespread acceptance in Ambedkarite groups and movements that emerged across India in the 1980s. What is unique about Dalit, therefore, is that it is a term that emerged from the political struggles of the oppressed castes, unlike administrative descriptions like Depressed Classes and Scheduled Castes and  ’s coinage, Harijan, which Ambedkar and his followers rejected as patronising. So to disallow the use of the word, Dalit, is essentially to ignore, if not reject, an important part of the political history of India’s oppressed castes. Despite the outreach of the BJP leadership, this government is battling perceptions that it is acting against the interests of Dalits. Incidents such as Rohith Vemula’s suicide, the flogging of Dalits in Una by gau rakshaks, the controversy over the Prevention of SC/ST Atrocities Act, and anti-Dalit violence in Western Uttar Pradesh and its aftermath have strengthened the perception that the   government is insensitive to Dalit concerns. The I&B ministry’s move is likely to harden this sentiment. For all the latest  , download "

Arguably the best Nike pitchman ever, MJ didn’t alienate any section of the market and thus guided the philosophy for sports marketers for years.

Nike’s latest face is a man who is the antithesis of Jordan. Colin Kaepernick, a former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, didn’t exactly set the football pitch on fire with his runs, but in 2016, he became one of the most recognisable NFL athletes across the globe when he knelt during the customary pre-match playing of the US National Anthem to protest injustice and police atrocities against African-Americans. Other black athletes followed suit and, before long, President Donald Trump and other Republicans were railing against the protesters, describing the gesture as a sign of disrespect to America. No NFL team signed Kaepernick in 2017 and his career came to a grinding halt. The league also banned on-field protests. It’s against this background that Nike, which incidentally also has an apparel deal with NFL, ran the Kaepernick ad. It’s a big risk, and the reaction has been swift. People have posted videos of their sneakers on fire, proclaiming they have chosen the country over their favourite footwear. But many more have shown solidarity with the brand and the athlete. There’s much to laud in the campaign, not least its tagline — “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything”. But it could also be accused of making protest a product and selling it. The campaign comes at a time when Trump’s propularity in America and abroad is at its lowest. If more and more non-Republicans flock to Nike stores, it may not matter much if Republicans buy the shoes or not. For all the latest  , download "
"September 5, 2018 12:10:07 am","Theatre of absurd","Tamil Nadu BJP president has done everything in her power to prove the case of a student who raised slogans against fascism ","Editorial","In Tamil Nadu, Stalin’s namesake in the DMK is supporting Lois Sophia, a student and an opponent of “fascism”, as the original had done on another continent, in another century. But the rest of the action at Tuticorin airport, where Tamil Nadu BJP president Tamilisai Soundararajan brought the might of the state to bear on Sophia, a politically engaged student of mathematics and physics who raised the slogan, “Fascist BJP government down, down,” is absurd drama at its political best. Soundararajan’s response, which was to have Sophia arrested, had an unintended consequence: It graphically proved the student’s point. To read opposition as a criminal act betrays a mindset that sits uneasily in a democracy. The police and the law officer who permitted remand are complicit by virtue of their automatism. Bail has been granted to Sophia, who stands accused under Sections 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 290 (causing public nuisance) of the Indian Penal Code, and under Section 75 of the Tamil Nadu City Police Act. But the case against her will proceed. And the matter was given a chilling edge when the state BJP chief spoke to the press. “No innocent girl would use that word,” she said. “I thought I shouldn’t ignore a terrorist… I cannot ignore it if my government is questioned in such a way.” Loss of innocence progressed seamlessly to the charge of terrorism, and the assertion that questioning the government is intolerable. Soundararajan also offered dark, nebulous allusions to Sophia’s links with the Sterlite protests and unspecified Canadian groups. In isolation, this would have been a mere absurdity, a stray case of political bullying and justice gone wrong. But the context makes it serious and sobering: The recent arrests of “urban Naxals” and their media trial by the Maharashtra police seems to have sharpened an atmosphere in which both ruling party politicians and the agencies of justice find it natural to arrest someone for protesting against the government in office, and designate her a terrorist. The court should have pulled up the police for arresting without serious cause, since Sophia had only repeated a slogan, without any threatening behaviour. But every buck cannot stop with the courts. The government must also address this situation, and strongly discourage the belief that state power can be used arbitrarily against dissenting citizens. There would have been no incident at Tuticorin airport if Soundararajan had taken the one-woman protest with good grace, or if she had reached out to the protester like a mature politician, instead of confirming her accusation by using the might of the state as a weapon to silence and subdue the student.
